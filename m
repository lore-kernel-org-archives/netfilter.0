Bufff....sounds interesting. But I think there's something that I don't 
get very well.
Outline:

       ** C-S Connection "sockets TCP".
       ** Proxi store the connection info (iptables FORWARD -j QUEUE)
       ** Proxi wants to replace Server, so, a new TCP Connexion is 
created locally C'/S'.
       ** C wants a content, hence, socket C -->recv();
       ** S-->send(content); proxi catchs payload and drops.
       ** S' do send with new payload (new port, IP, ack, seq). And 
obviously C' do nothing.
       ** C receives the content, since It wants to ACK to S, then it 
send ACK.(S doesn't realize their packets are drop)
       ** Also S' wants the ACK...to maintain both flow control.
                   So.....I don't understand very well the raw packets 
that you has suggested me.
                   I was thinking to get the ack reply  and a the same 
trick as before with the original payload.
                   Do you suggest me to create myself a new ack packet 
in my local machine to ACK the content what S' has sent?
                   Raw packets.....The kernel doesn't process them and I 
can create my own IP/TCP headers, isn't it?
       To summarize...one Client-2 servers, nobody knows who is in 
communication with whom, but the flow control is maintained.

Thanks.

Hmm.  There should be at most one retry.

The confirmed bit should always be set here.
If it isn't then this conntrack shouldn't be in the hash table, i.e.
when we re-try we should find the same conntrack again with the bit set.

Asuming the other cpu git interrupted after setting confirmed
bit but before inserting it into the hash table, then our re-try
should not be able find a matching entry.

Maybe I am missing something, but I don't see how we could (upon
retry) find the very same entry again with the bit still not set.

I don't think that would make sense, because it should always be
set (inserting conntrack into hash table without confirmed set is
illegal, and it is never unset again).

[ when allocating a new conntrack, ct->status is zeroed, which also
  clears the flag.  This happens just before we set the new objects
  refcount to 1 ]

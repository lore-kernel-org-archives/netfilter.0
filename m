ipset is a tool to build up so called sets inside the Linux kernel. The 
sets have any use in the kernel side only and there the kernel matches 
single IP addresses and never whole networks.

But if you say so, let it be a bug. Won't be fixed in the near future, 
however, as it has got a very low priority.

The single set type in v4.x which incidentally had the feature you are 
missing was the iptreemap type alone. The *hash set types in ipset 4.x 
behaved exactly the same way as the current ones (ignoring the fact that 
the 4.x versions had more limitations and less functionality than the 
successor hash:* types in ipset 6.x).

This breaks IPoA -> NAT -->VLAN for me.  Before, with a virgin 2.6.28.4 
I had no traffic.  With this patch,  what was a 50ms ping, jumps to
1050ms  and randomly there are duplicate packets.

What Patrick,  said may be the case,  that the underlaying atm driver is
not specifying the headroom.   The driver is ported to 2.6.28 from
2.6.11 based on the BSD licensed intel libaries:
http://www.intel.com/design/network/products/npfamily/download_ixp400.htm

Where underneath a bunch of layers the skb is allocated with kmalloc like:

size = PAGE_ALIGN (size + CACHE_LINE_SIZE);
order = get_order (size);
page = alloc_pages (GFP_KERNEL, order);


Why though does the same driver work with IPoE  Bridged ATM   RFC2684  ?


The other module in use is CLIP  net/atm/clip.c      I don't have any
other hardware though to test the CLIP driver with though.


A side note:  so far the original patch i sent works in all cases i have
tested, but fails with tcpdump.   I suspect its because the skb gets cloned.

Thanks,


Karl.

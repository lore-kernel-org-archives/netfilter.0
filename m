Hi Pablo,

Sorry, didn't notice that it has the same bug. Do you want that in the
same patch, or separate?

I don't think that's possible, the facility is copied down to user-space
consumers and it has to be zero for the message to be identified as
originating from the kernel (0 is LOG_KERN).

As it boils down to a single test for KERN_SOH_ASCII I don't think it
matters very much.

Thanks!

Do not use 2.4.20 if you want to use connection tracking.  2.4.20
connection tracking is totally broken due to a change introduced in the
core kernel.

Please do always use patch-o-matic from CVS.  The patch you want to
apply for fixing this bug is 10_confirm_fix.patch

without using a larger hash size (modprobe ip_conntrack hashsize=3Dfoo,
wherer foo should be a prime number and in the range of 524280/2)

I've seen systems with way more conntrack entries and higher bandwith.
Using NAT however, might have a big performance impact.

With a non-broken kernel it is 2 minutes, that is TIME_WAIT of a TCP
socket.

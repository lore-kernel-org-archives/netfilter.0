So a few people had been asking on whether ipset 5.x will be bundled=20
along with Xtables-addons. Naturally this is a difficult question=20
because ipset-5 wants a kernel patch. But yes, it is included as of Xt-=
a=20
1.32 (just out).

It has been augmented to not require the patch anymore, by moving it=20
over from nfnetlink (booo) to genetlink which does not depend on static=
=20
numbers, though you will need at least Linux 2.6.35 for this GENL=20
variant in both compilation and at runtime.
(As such, ipset-5 is deactivated by default in Xt-a 1.32 and needs to b=
e=20
turned on in mconfig.)


Xt-a files at the usual place.

The plain genl patch to ipset-5 can be found as a commit at=20
git://dev.medozas.de/ipset in the "genl" branch. It has received a run=20
through the testsuite (as far as it went until ospf), and I take that a=
s=20
an indication that proxying the protocol onto genl was successful.

Could you check the attached patch?

Wouldn't that break the regular case of packets forwarded
through a single bridge?

Yes, though the underlying problem seems to be that skb->nf_bridge
has no clearly defined lifetime. We want to pass the bridge port
information up exactly one layer, and then it should disappear.
But that seems to require sprinkling nf_bridge_put in lots of places.

Thats really odd. It properly adjusts the sequence number in the
original direction by +1, but incorrectly adjusts the acknowledgement
in the reply direction by -2. I don't see how this could happen with
the vanilla 2.6.22 kernel, are you using any additional patches?

Otherwise please edit net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_nat_helper.c and add
a #define DEBUG at the first line, recompile and post the output
of the failed session (ideally two failed sessions). Thanks.

What I meant was that whatever the prefix *you* decide to put in, for 
*me* it won't matter as long as it does its job.

I learn something new every day. Then it makes even more sense to store 
the protocol as a number, not as string for easier matching - useful if 
you one day decide to apply masking (or other convenient form of 
searching) against the captured protocol (which could also be a number).

Fair enough. Any idea when ipset 5.2 will be incorporated into xtables 
so that I could download it and start testing it? *nudges Jan*

As it stands, I do not have enough information to build the rpm spec 
file in order to create a complete xtables rpm package to incorporate 
your version of ipset (without this I cannot distribute it across my 
test machines easily), so unless I am able to build this rpm the whole 
thing is a no go from me.

If I understand you correctly, you keep a separate structure which 
stores all prefixes used in the target set, walk through that structure 
and for each element you build start-end range based on the IP address 
captured and the current prefix. You then create a hash on the 
calculated start-end range, protocol and port triple and then test that 
hash against the hash value of the target set triple (IP range, 
protocol, port). Is that how you do it?

I understand that things are a bit easier with hash:ip,protocol,port as 
you don't need to store prefixes - you just calculate the hashes and 
match them against the corresponding hashes of the set triple, right?

Couldn't the same be said for the hash (or any other?) ipsets as well? I 
am not using that 'feature' anyway, as I include the ip addresses/ranges 
manually from script files (though some of them are automatically 
generated and are based on the geoip database which is downloaded at 
regular intervals), so that 'vulnerability' does not apply to me.

How is that changed in the hash (or bitmap even) ipsets - would that not 
be the same then: an attacker crafts specifically designed packets to 
include certain ip/port ranges in a set (*a* set - it could be any set)?

I think the culprit is not the set itself, but the SET target as I find 
it rather foolish that someone would let an outsider to manipulate a set 
using this SET target. For example, if I am an attacker and I know that 
the target machine relies on access to certain IP address, then I could 
craft a packet in such a way that it triggers this SET target which then 
includes the IP address/range in the 'attackers' set and therefore 
disable access to that address on the target machine - job done!

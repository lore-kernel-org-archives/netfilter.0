I can reproduce this with forwarding between two bridges.
The reason is that skb->nf_bridge still contains the data
from the first bridge and so br_netfilter thinks this is
a bridged packet. I don't know how this is supposed to work,
but it seems to me that on packets going out a bridge device
this should be reset in case it originates from a different
bridge (actually I think it should be reset unconditionally
but that would probably break bridged DNAT).

Bart, what do you think about changing this:

static unsigned int br_nf_local_out(unsigned int hook, struct sk_buff 
*skb, ...
{
	...
         nf_bridge = skb->nf_bridge;
         if (!(nf_bridge->mask & BRNF_BRIDGED_DNAT))
                 return NF_ACCEPT;

to:

         if (!(nf_bridge->mask & BRNF_BRIDGED_DNAT)) {
		nf_bridge_put(skb->nf_bridge),
		skb->nf_bridge = NULL;
		return NF_ACCEPT;
	}

?

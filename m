That was not so hard, I hesitated just a little bit to add new features 
before the release.

You meant hash:net,port and hash:ip,port. Of course they are different. In 
hash:net,port you can store different sized netblock and port pairs, while 
in hash:ip,port you can store just IP address and port pairs. Let me show 
you an example:

# ipset create foo hash:net,port
# ipset add foo 192.168.0.0/30,80
# ipset list foo
Name: foo
Type: hash:net,port
Header: family inet hashsize 1024 maxelem 65536

Name: bar
Type: hash:ip,port

Binding was unfortunately a bad ideas therefore had to be dropped. The 
multidimensional sets and the list of sets fairly well replace it.

No, that's just a shorthand notation. If the protocol is left out then TCP 
is assumed. If you need the same port with TCP and UDP, then you have to 
add both to the set. Just using the examle set bar above:

# ipset add bar 192.168.0.1,tcp:53
# ipset add bar 192.168.0.1,udp:53
# ipset list bar
Name: bar
Type: hash:ip,port
Header: family inet hashsize 1024 maxelem 65536

That won't be so easy for Jan, and it's up to him to decide, which ipset 
tree he wants to support in xtables-addons: the old one which does not 
need kernel patching or the new one with the burden of the netlink.patch.

In order to support kernel versions below 2.6.31, I had to add a lot of 
#ifdefs in xt_set.c to support the countless API changes in netfilter 
targets and matches. Hm, maybe I could support kernel releases from 
2.6.24. Below 2.6.24 there are missing netlink definitions as Jan 
mentioned.

Hi,

I am having difficulty in PPP connection between 2 machines and not able to figure out how to solve it. I have a windows machine connected to my phone running 3.0 kernel though dial-up connection. The PPP connection terminates on Phone.

When I run below commands on phone, it shows below output.

#ip rule show

32764:  from all iif rmnet0 lookup PS_DUN
32765:  from all iif ppp0 lookup PS_DUN

32767:  from all lookup default

On a setup (running 2.6.35 kernel) I have same output for above commands. But here the packets are forwarded out of phone correctly.

Is there any kernel configuration I am missing in 3.0?

Can anyone help in this?

Thanks,
Hemant

That is definitely a much better way than to hardcode the
matches. I think there is some interest in having this in
the kernel, yes.

I know of the regexp.old.zip library, which IIRC used a GPL
compatible license (and a non-POSIX conform interface).

I'd also prefer that over adding a regex library to the kernel.
I think one of the bigger problems is that there are dependencies
in the match that can't be easily expressed, like "byte 4 has
skb->len - 10". At least ipp2p does something like that. But
maybe thats not necessary, since l7filter already uses regexes
there's apparently a different method for doing this.

It would be useful if someone could post an excerpt from the
l7filter expressions or simply the entire patch.

Yes, thats another possibilty (and a lot of people are doing
that), but it would still be nice to have a mechanism for
doing this in the kernel.

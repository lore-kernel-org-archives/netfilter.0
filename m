Right; but is that not what might be described as "hypocritic"?
Even after adding support for CT.0, people still need >=3D 2.6.34.
Where is the non-breakage for them?

(I can't say I feel /too/ bad for the RHEL folks stuck with their
ancient 2.6.32 :-P )
(And don't tell me about backports, because in general, they don't
do that for NF.)

Hi Rick,

The ESP itself will presumably be for a security association (SA) which
terminates on the machine, but it could easily be for some tunnel, in
which case the unencrypted packet should be sent through FORWARD instead 
of INPUT.

Logically, it makes sense to me that the packet should pass through the 
whole of Netfilter _again_ after it's been decapsulated, similarly to what 
now happens with FreeS/WAN (but presumably without an ipsec0 interface 
being involved). Or, maybe it should be decapsulated before routing (and 
hence visible unencrypted in FORWARD, INPUT and OUTPUT).

Cheers, Chris.

=C2=A0The reason why is in the kernel documentation distributed with th=
e source code.
=E2=80=8EIts not all immediately obvious why and where the kernel does =
this unless you were involved in the original debates about it. The pro=
blems with binding a public ip address to a loopback address are more r=
ecently is partialy selinux but mostly of it is because of how routing =
changed when iproute2 was introduced in the 2.2 kernel (if I remember t=
he versions correctly it was so long ago). The reason is security, many=
 processes bind to the loopback interface for IPC and just grab the fir=
st address on the first lo device they find, some of the developers of =
the applications weren't even aware they were doing it because in some =
cases it was C libraries several layers deep doing it because odd loopb=
ack addresses were common on UNIX ( I remember an AIX admin back in the=
 early 90's telling me I should always use addresses like 127.1.0.2 on =
the loopback because it was valid made it harder for script kiddies to =
attack processes ). This was fine when additional addresses would need =
additional alias on the interface for ifconfig (lo:1 for example) but w=
ith iproute2 you could now assign multiple ip addresses to an interface=
 without creating an alias (commonly seen on the keepalived mailing lis=
t "why doesn't my VIP show up in ifconfig?")
So there was a decision made to declare all subnets assigned to the loo=
pback interface as unroutable to prevent a lot of very common security =
holes that were being seen in the wild.

That said you can make it work but you have to do a lot of things you s=
hould never do on a firewall like turn off selinux.=E2=80=8E Or you can=
 simply use the dummy driver and bind your public IP's to that and the =
problems magically go away. And it makes a lot of sense why else would =
there be a need for the dummy network driver?

What you write seems odd to me, we don't treat lo devices differently t=
o=20
dummy devices in respect if you bind a public ip address on it.

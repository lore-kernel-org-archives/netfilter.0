Hello all,

This is a repost of a message I sent yesterday to linux-kernel. I
understand I should have sent it there right away. Please note, that
another instance of (probably) the same problem on an ia64 platform has
also been reported by David Mosberger on linux-kernel, and he has a
better trace than I do. Please see
<http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=3Dlinux-kernel&m=3D106730476106084&w=3D2=
>=20
and  <http://tinyurl.com/sm9d> for his report.

Please, Cc me any answer.

Thanks,

	=C9ric Brunet

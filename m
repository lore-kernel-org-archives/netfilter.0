Hi, 

Does the netfilter_queue support the multi-thread 
processing? In other words, I use one thread to receive 
packets from the netfilter_queue (Use recv() function). In 
the meanwhile, I dispatch them to other threads (Another 6 
threads) to process by using Round-Robin method (Use 
nfq_set_verdict() function when the processing is 
finished). If so, does it cause any stability issues to 
the system (e.g. Cause kernel panic)?

Thank you very much!

Regards,

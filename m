I think because it is *not* widely known. The credit is yours for

No, that's not possible with "recent".

Because connlimit/connbytes rely on conntrack, the latter should be 
"fixed". However I do not see any way to make it resistant against such 
attacks: if we shrink the window (by which alogrithm?) we may block valid 
RST segments and thus cause connections to hang instead of termination.

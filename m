sure, I'd be happy to add it to the homepage and patch-o-matic.
However, I'd actually prefer if it could be added to the
netfilter-extensions HOWTO.  This would give people a chance to learn
about all the different targets/matches at a single location.

Bill, in case you don't know the extensions HOWTO:
http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO//netfilter-extensions-HOWTO.ht=
ml

Would you be willing to merge your u32 documentation with that?

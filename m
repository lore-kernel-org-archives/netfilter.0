Cc.ed Thomas Graf (tgraf@redhat.com), Thomas presented some interesting 
ideas on netlink error-codes and strings during NetConf 2010, see:

I like this.

To support internationalization, we could just add an error-number-code 
in front of the constructed error message?

I'm a fan of the full error message system from the kernel, becuase its 
much easier to maintain, as we don't need to update iptables userspace 
each time we introduce a new error code/message.

This patch was applied already.  Infact, I'm using Gentoo (but using the=20
'vanilla' kernel from gentoo, so its not got every patch under the sun), an=
d=20
I specifically picked out and applied the followint patches:
018_gcc31-compile-optimizations
021_ecc-20020904
701_iptables-20_iptables-proc
702_iptables-24_conntrack-nosysctl

724_iptables-u32

Please let me know if you think one is missing I should try.

I'll try this and report back.

Well, this system itself isn't doing 'nat', however, by implication, the ab=
ove=20
rule makes every connection nat'd.

That was not my point.  My point was, for up to 5 days later, the system st=
ill=20
has entries in the conntrack table (listed as 'ESTABLISHED'), which have be=
en=20
dead and gone for a long time, conntrack does not realise that connection i=
s=20
utterly closed, and it should drop its conntrack entry.  I'm not as worried=
=20
about the lower-value timeouts, but as I said, I saw ALOT of established=20
connections hanging around in the conntrack table (making the conntrack tab=
le=20
about 200,000 entries long, give or take), most of which were entries for=20
connections already closed.

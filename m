Well, as indicated in my last emai:

1) it is dangerous to increment the TTL
2) still, there are vallid uses.

In gerneral, incrementing packets heading towards your internal network
shouldn't be a problem.  If people want to hide their internal network
structure from traceroute, they have two options:

a) drop all packets that have a ttl < number_of_hops_in_internal_net
b) increment the TTL by number_of_hops_in_internal_net

Both ways make sure that the TTL never expires on a router in the
internal network.

Where 'a' would interrupt traffic, and 'b' would make sure traffic
passes.

Also, sometimes ISP's try to detect if you are running a router/gateway
behind your DSL line by checking for well-known TTL values.  In this
case, setting the TTL=20

The most dangerous cases of incrementing the TTL are:

a) incrementing the TTL of transit traffic (not close to sender or
receiver)
b) incrementing the TTL of multicast traffic

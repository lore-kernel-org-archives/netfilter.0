Interesting. Can you apply the following patch? It should help to
debug the issue. Basically, it displays the conntrack unique ID. They
should have different IDs.

Can you catch the last event before this one below? I'd like to know
in what TCP state the flow was before the destroy event.

That's not normal. I guess you have tcp pick enabled:

cat /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_tcp_loose

shows 1. That allows conntrack to create new entries from the first
packet seen (no mater if it's not a tcp syn packet). It seems that
conntrack is creating a new TCP established flow for some late packet
retransmission. Florian Westphal posted a patch to reduce the default
timeout for pickup flows:

6547a22 netfilter: nf_conntrack: avoid large timeout for mid-stream pickup

That should mitigate this effect. Still, you'll have to trace traffic
from your network to reach the root cause of this. You can gather pcap
traces of the BGP's TCP connection, as it seems reproducible with it,
to simplify things. I think both things are different manifestations
of the same issue.

Thanks for the very detailed report. Let me know how it goes with your
tracing.

Regards.

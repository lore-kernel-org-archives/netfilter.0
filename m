This is easily possible using JSON API alone as that doesn't have the
naming limitations. Depending on personal interpretation, this could
mean the problem is far worse than "some exotic tool is able to disturb
nft" or it is actually pretty common and "just another case of 'nft list
ruleset | nft -f -' being broken". I tend towards the latter, but agree
that it is a serious issue.

It was merely a quick hack. :)

I didn't find a better way to conditionally parse two following args as
strings instead of just a single one. Basically I miss an explicit end
condition from which to call BEGIN(0).

What is the problem?

Thanks, Phil

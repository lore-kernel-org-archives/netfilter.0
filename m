Unless you have a very specific traffic profile, both of these limits
are far too low.

(While it will work, that sysctl is just for backwards compat.
Use net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_tcp_timeout_established instead.)

That setting is the inactive timeout, not the maximum duration.
There is no way to specify a maximum duration that I know of.  You
could get your accounting application to delete them after the maximum
duration.  eg using nfctnetlink or the conntrack userspace tool.

Also note that if you want to enforce a maximum duration, you'll
need to disable nf_conntrack_tcp_loose, otherwise the conntrack will
just get created again on the next packet.

There are settings for other protocols in the same place
eg net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_{udp,icmp,generic}_timeout

Removing a conntrack for a connection that is still alive isn't
going to leave it undisturbed.  These timeouts are a tradeoff between
the likelihood of a connection being stale versus it being alive
but inactive.

As I mentioned above, these are the inactive timeouts.

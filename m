Yes, good point!

Yes, this patch looks like formally needed, but I guess currently it
isn't used by any path: otherwise we would know about it earlier.

Alas I've been mostly interested in verifying your first suspicion of
skb_cow_head() bug, and not so much in this driver ;-) IMHO after your
current findings the driver definitely looks like the main sinner. I'm
glad you found these hacks to make it workable, but I hope you realize
your data could be still corrupted in more or less visible way.

I looked only a bit into ixp400_eth.c without tracking libraries and
there are some rather strange things I didn't found in other drivers
like skb->truesize use. It looks like both skb and skb->header could
be used together for this recycling without respect for clones. If
so, this could still break in many places e.g.: if it affected you in
__vlan_put_tag() it seems this dev_queue_xmit_nit() could hit you too,
depending on your config or even size of packets. So I guess, knowing
this all, you should better try to hack this driver more yet.

Cheers,

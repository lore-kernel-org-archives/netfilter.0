I'm not sure if that's relevant or not.  Are you basing that on there
being 4 hits listed in my /proc output, whereas I have the hitcount at 5?

The problem persists even with the hitcount at 10.  Actually, it seems to
continue to misbehave up until 20, but seems to behave at 21 or higher
(with --seconds 40).

If my second attempt to connect is more than 40 seconds after the first,
it connects OK, but if it's less than 40 seconds after the first, it won't
let me connect.  It's as if it's ignoring the hitcount unless it's higher
than 20.

I tried with --seconds 30 and could find no correlation to the duration of
time between first and second attempts and whether the second attempt was
successful or not.

It's as if I just don't understand the interaction between --seconds and
--hitcount.  I believe they interact like so:

  If there have been [hitcount] packets from the source IP in the last
  [seconds] seconds, then the rule will match

Is this correct?

I'm not sure, I've only ever had this version set up.

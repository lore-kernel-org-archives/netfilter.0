Is your kernel patched with p-o-m from iptables 1.2.8, or is it really a 
stock 2.4.20 kernel without any patches?

You might want to try upgrading with at least the current p-o-m patches..  
there has been numerous fixes to NAT of local traffic not too long ago.
Also make sure you have the kernel option for NAT of local traffic
enabled.

Well that won't impact is positively nor negatively. It has always
been that way, and whether people get libipt_{SET,set} through
iptables or the ipset tarball - it would not matter.

Just because something is limited to IPv4 does not mean it is
not 'x' ('x' as in xtables). It is all just names, and getting it
under one unified hut is a good thing. In fact, onnnnnnnnce (;-)
I get around to submit the next patchsets, we will have xt modules
that have neither IPv4 nor IPv6 components.

Benefits?
- removing 73% of all #ifdef kludges from *.c (the kernel files)
- less tarballs for users to build
- autoconf for the binary :-P

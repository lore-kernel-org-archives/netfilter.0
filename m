You are free to design and implement a better one.

Yes, assuming that first you lookup the IP address, then lookup the 
protocoll and then the port. That's three successive lookups, not one.

The implementation behind ipset looks up the  (ipaddr, proto, port) triple 
in one step. Such packing don't work there.

I run dibbler DHCPv6 server. It listens on UDP with IPv6 only:

# lsof -i6|grep dibbler
dibbler-s 18060   root    5u  IPv6 13581079       UDP [ff02::1:2]:547 
dibbler-s 18060   root    6u  IPv6 13581082       UDP [ff02::1:2]:547 

The clients (Linux, Windows) work flawlessly without TCP.

I do not assume you run a single server. The point is, you know the IP 
addresses, protocols, ports. Had you iptables rules you had to enter so 
many rules as the addresses, protocols, ports dictate.

Our mySQL servers seem to listen on TCP only. Out of curiosity I checked 
the manuals and it states TCP only for listening on.

This is exactly the behaviour shown by kernels that have not the above bug =
fix
applied.=20

Can you please verify that this is indeed a conntrack bug?  Can you do
some tcpdump capturing that actually shows that there was a connection
teardown (FIN handshake or RST) and after it, conntrack state of the
respective connection stays ESTABLISHED?

I just want to make sure that this is really some problem about a
possible conntrack bug - not some application that forgets to fully
close TCP connections..

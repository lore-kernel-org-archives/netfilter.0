That rule cannot simulate full-cone NAT, because netfilter implements 
port-restricted cone NAT.

The connection tracking subsystem does not support TCP simultaneous open.

As far as I'm concerned, I do not care whatever RFC is created in trying 
to push NAT over its limits - that is just a totally wrong track. NAT was 
invented solely to slow down the depletion of the IPv4 address space in 
the hope to give more time introducing and *deploying* IPv6 world-wide. 
And everyone was fully aware that NAT breaks one of the key concempts of 
IP, the end-to-end connectivity. These "NAT behavioral requirements" RFCs 
are the results of that breakage (and written exclusively from the point 
of view of the application designers).

It is no point trying to *put back* end-to-end connectivity on top of NAT 
when the clear and straight solution is to go to IPv6. 

The end-to-end connectivity is the very reason why I refuse the idea to 
implement NAT for IPv6 in netfilter. The damage what IPv4 NAT produced 
hasn't taught us not to repeat the same mistake again, willingly?

Best regads,
Jozsef

I think that's the right way to do these
sorts of trivial changes too.

Individual patches cc'd to maintainers for
feedback, improvement, acks or to be directly
applied to their trees, followed by a longish
delay before any unapplied patches are taken
up as a single patch by your trivial queue.

Thanks for doing that work Jiri.

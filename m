This issue came to my attention in the end of August, I produced a patch
and I never heard from that person again. The patch is quite ugly but it
does solve this specific problem. I was waiting for some more input from
other developers before submitting it to cvs but now I've given up on
that and I've submitted it. patch-o-matic in cvs now works with
debugging enabled.

or you can apply this patch on your kernel after patching with the
patch-o-matic you are currently using:

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat
you with experience.

Hi Min,

I think the problem is that the xdmcp protocol requires a special
helper module to add the necessary connection expectations, since
it appears to open random connections, like ftp for instance.

This raises an interesting question: Here:
http://cvs.netfilter.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/netfilter-extensions/helpers/xdmc=
p/
is some work on a conntrack helper/nat module by Hojae Lee, apparently.

I've never heard any noise about this, the code is not available in
standard patch-o-matic, and I am also wondering what the whole
/netfilter-extensions CVS directory is all about ?
Perhaps Harald knows more about this...

Regards,
Filip

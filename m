I will give it some testing.  My Opteron box only runs 2.6.x kernels,
which seem to work fine with iptables.

mh. The only idea I have is that you've somehow ended up with a 32bit
iptables (which won't work).  It has to be compiled in the same mode as
the kernel itself - to assure that structure sizes/alignment/... are
consistent.

OK but as pointed by Jan Engelhardt, same table can be used with
different matches and different delays, so your patch is not good. You
should add a parameter (--reap or some flag) to iptables rule to ask fo=
r
this reap, and not let it happen in general case.

iptables -A ... -m recent --name foo --seconds 60 -j DOTHAT
iptables -A ... -m recent --name foo --seconds 3600 --reap -j ELSE

Also, I am convinced your reap pointer is not good, because it can poin=
t
to an entry that is renewed once per second for example, and reaper wil=
l
be frozen.

You should use lru_list.next only, because this one is guaranted to
point to the oldest entry in table

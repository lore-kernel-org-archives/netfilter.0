I assume you mean that a client behind an NATting gateway has sent out a=20
packet (perhaps an HTTP request) which has been SNATted in POSTROUTING=20
so that it uses the gateway's public IP instead of the client's private=20
IP - and you are asking about the return traffic.

They come to the NATting box from the destination of the original packet,=
=20
and hit PREROUTING.  They are recognized as being replies to outbound=20
traffic that was SNATted, so while in nat PREROUTING (or just after, I'm=20
not certain) the SNAT that was performed on the request is reversed on=20
the reply, so that the destination IP is changed from the gateway's=20
public IP to the client's private IP. =20

After PREROUTING a routing decision is made, which recognizes these=20
packets as destined for a client machine on the local network, NOT the=20
gateway itself.  (the unSNAT has already taken place, the DestIP is now=20
the original client)  At this point the packet goes to the FORWARD=20
chain, and so long as it is ACCEPTed there, it goes to POSTROUTING and=20
then out the local interface to the original client machine.

Nope.  INPUT is for packets destined for the gateway machine itself in=20
this scenario.  While the return packets have that machine's public IP=20
as their destination when they come in, this is changed to the IP of the=20
original client before routing decision, so they go to FORWARD instead=20
of INPUT.  OUTPUT would be for traffic originating on the gateway=20
itself.

>        changed at the local process ?

All these changes are handled by netfilter in the kernel, before anything=
=20
in userspace ever sees the packet.  A local process normally cannot see=20
a packet unless the routing decision determines that it is destined for=20
the local box (the one running the firewall rules) and sends it to the=20
INPUT chain, which would have to ACCEPT it.  THEN it would be possible=20
for a local userspace process to see the packet.

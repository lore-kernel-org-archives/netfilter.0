Not depending of static numbers is a good thing to me because it makes
the whole user-space simpler since: a) you don't have to send a message
to perform the initial family ID lookup and b) you don't have to
subscribe to genl control events (which is required since the the
floating family number may change if the module is unloaded).

This is going to confuse everyone. Since ipset-5 will be submitted into
mainline soon, some distributors may start packaging the user-space gen=
l
binaries. Then, once we have it into the kernel, the distributed versio=
n
will not work with the one running upon nfnetlink.

I think it's way easier to submit a patch to reserve the subsystem ID
for ipset than adding this genl compatibility layer.

BTW, Jozsef, do you plan to submit ipset for the next linux kernel
release cycle?

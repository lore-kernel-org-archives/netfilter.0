The thing is, /proc/net/ip_tables_matches's seq_start function takes
the lock, lets it iterate, and drops the lock on seq_stop. That is
easy for a single list (xt[af].match), but when you want to make
matches from more than just one nfproto visible in that file, you
need to drop the lock during seq_next, and acquire the next one too.
Not only that, but you also have to switch the list you are
traversing, which is currently conveniently passed through the "v"
variable. And you need to keep track of the nfproto whose list you
are iterating through, because seq_stop can be called with either one
currently being traversed.

You know exactly what I meant.

OK, so you store IP address and then the range. Do you then perform the 
process as I described above in order to find a match?

Anything which manipulates the internal structure from outside is, in my 
opinion, not a good idea for the reason I mentioned above.

On a separate note, once I've installed ipset 5.2 I am very keen on 
testing both type of sets (iptreemap and the new hash set) to see what 
is the performance penalty with the new sets (there will probably be one 
as your search algorithm is more complex in 5.x and would require more 
iterations compared with the 4.x type sets).

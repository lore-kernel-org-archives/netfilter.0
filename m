[sorry for the late reply]

Maybe I am using the linklayer atm option wrong:

1. I am using it with a PCI ADSL modem. As the kernel "knows" that it's
dealing with an ATM device, is there any need to even specify the option
in the first place?

2. My methodology for calculating the overall speed limit for the device
is to download several large files and see what throughput I get. I then
use this figure in the rules above. However, as soon as I add a
linklayer option, the maximum throughout of the device obviously drops,
but means that I never get the throughput that I know the line is
capable of. Assuming that I should even be using the linklayer atm
option, should I be specifying the line speed higher than that which I
physically observe during line speed tests?

For example, if I observe an ADSL line speed of 4000kbit/s, I then
specify 3600kbit/s for the root of the HTB class, but with the linklayer
atm option I only get about 3200kbit/s. Should I be specifying a higher
value in order to get the most out of the connection?

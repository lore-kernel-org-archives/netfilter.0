true.

yes. It is a module written by Hojae Lee, and while it apparently seems
to work, it raises a couple of fundamental security problems.

I didn't want to put this code in netfilter patch-o-matic, since it
definitely would introduce security vulnerabilities.

Unfortunately I didn't get around fixing that code yet, so it remains
unchanged in CVS for now.

the netfilter-extensions CVS directory has been discussed on
netfilter-devel before.  The idea is to have the _real_ code in CVS, not
the patches.   From netfilter-extensions the patches are generated,
which will then be put into patch-o-matic.

CVS is meant for source code, not for patches.

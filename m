The "test" functionality is already overloaded. It has two "modes":

- you can test how the *kernel* sees the set, when checking a single IP
  address
- you can check whether an *exact* element is added to the set or not.

As the first one overloads the second one, for hash:*net* types the second 
mode is already "incomplete" in the sense that one cannot check whether a 
given single IP address is already added to a hash:*net* type of set as an 
exact element or not, because a network element may match it.

Your request means a third mode, which could lead to even more confusion, 
because that way one could not check whether the tested address as 
*element* is added to the set or not.

There's no magical element-aggregation in the hash:* types. That is, even 
if 10.1.0.0/16 is added as an element, 10.1.0.0/24 can be added again as 
an independent element: either it should be rejected (when the command was 
issued without the --exist flag) or silently ignored (when was issued with 
it). So even to consider your feature requests, it could come only after 
implementing element-aggregation.

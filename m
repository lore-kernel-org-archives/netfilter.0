Mmm, sure.  But if it is directed to INPUT, it should still be
decapsulated.

I thought about this for a while trying to figure out how to do so
without an extra interface.  Maybe a netfilter rule to decapsulate and
requeue to PREROUTING?

If the packet were being routed by the local host (i.e. from one subnet
to another) we'd want to preserve the encapsulation.  Actually, we
probably wouldn't be able to decapsulate it.

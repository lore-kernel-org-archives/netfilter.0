Than it wouldn't be able to deal with DST I guess. As I said, the
kernel already has knowledge about the timezone, so it should be
possible to do this properly quite easily, but I have no interest
in doing this myself.

From a quick look I'd say:

- move to x_tables
- remove ip_conntrack stuff
- clean up
- fix up for recent API changes and improvements
- fix 32/64 bit issues
- use proper list macros
- use kzalloc

And explain to me why it needs knowledge about TCP states. That should
be enough to get a discussion started.

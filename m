/* The unwritten laws of netlink */

Normally, the sequence number of a response message is simply
the one from the request message. But in a dump where there
can be multiple messages, do they all share the sequence number?

Must the response sequence numbers match at all, or is it like TCP
where each side has its own set?

BTW, can response messages - all those leading up to NLMSG_DONE -
have different nlmsg_type, or not? Does the nlmsg_type need
to match the request type?

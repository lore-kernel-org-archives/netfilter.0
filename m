FWIW, I think the existing semantics are spot-on.
  - Where did this packet come from (what was its source)?
    It came from src IF eth0.
  - Where is this packet going (what is its destination)?
    It is going to dst IF eth3.

Picture yourself standing in the middle of a (shallow) river. By Mr. Dash 
Four's logic, upstream (where the water comes from) is the destination and 
downstream (where the water is going) is the source; it's rather non-sensical. 
A stream of packets, just like a stream of water, flows from its source toward 
its destination. (A pedant might say that to swap 'source' and 'destination' 
would be to pervert language. And language is about the only thing we can use 
to communicate.)

Perhaps it would help to view netfilter as a small wayside in the universe of 
IPv[46], rather than the center of that universe.

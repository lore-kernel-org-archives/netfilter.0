Well, I have no problems already merging parts that make sense on
their own, but this patchset kind of stops in the middle.

My suggestions would be for me to merge patches 01-08 and you
include the remaining ones in a series that actually need that
change. If you manage to submit that series in time for 2.6.35,
even better. How does that sound?

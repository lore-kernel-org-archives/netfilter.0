It does matter. Non-intuitive syntax and notation are bad. Moreover, the 
notation should be open to handle other protocols too (see below).

sctp, udplite.

ICMP and ICMPv6 already interpreted as "proto":"port" by ipset, regardless 
that "port" is actually type and code.

Double check and triple check both the kernel and userspace of ipset 5. 
Get more feedback, especially from uncommon architecture. Submit for 
kernel inclusion. After that new features can be added.

Yes, exactly.

Besides the elements, the different prefixes are also stored in the set. 
So the test set in the example "knows" that the prefixes 30 and 24 occur 
only and use only those to find a match, starting from the most speficic 
prefix to the least one.

The iptree(map) sets store the elements in a tree structure which follows 
the dotted decimal notation of the IPv4 addresses. Let's assume, someone 
catches attackers by a given match and stores their IP addresses in the 
iptree type of set called "attackers":

# If some matches are true, it's an attacker, store the address
...... -j SET attackers src
# Drop known attackers
.... -m set attackers src -j DROP

What I referred to was that it's not hard to send forged packets, which 
create the widest and least filled in (i.e. worst) tree structure. It does 
not slow down the set but pushes it to the worst memory usage case.

I regard it as a weakness of the type: an attacker must not be able to 
trigger any worst case situation of a set type intentionally.

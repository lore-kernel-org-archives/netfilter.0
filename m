Hello,

I'm happy to release a new version of ipset. This is a bugfix release, no 
new features added. The list of the fixes:

- kernel part: a nasty typo which can lead to kernel crash when 
  creating a set is fixed in the macipmap type
- userspace tool:
  - segfault on --unbind :all: :all: fixed (reported by cheetah and Tom 
    Eastep)
  - User input parameters are sanitized everywhere
  - Initial testsuite added: few bugs discovered and fixed
    - typo in macipmap type prevented to use max size set of this type
    - *map types are made sure to allow and use max size of sets

You can download the ipset-1.3.1 source tree and the patch-o-matic-ng 
snapshot from http://ipset.netfilter.org/.

The sources can be downloaded directly from the git and svn repositories
as well:

Best regards,

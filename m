Hi!

As we all know, loading a big ruleset can be quite slow, even when using
iptables-restore.

Back in June last year I added some improvements to libiptc, providing
about 40% speedup when loading my artificial 1000-chain 10000-rule ruleset.

However, there were still a couple of algorithms with too high
computational complexity left in libiptc.  They could not be eliminated
without a complete rewrite.

During the last week, I did that [painful, and probably still quite buggy]
complete rewrite - it has just been commited to CVS.

Let the numbers speak for themselves:

Loading a ruleset with 1000 chains, each 10 rules with iptables-restore
on an Intel P3-733:

original code (iptables-1.2.8)
	3m55.575s (3m27.310s/0m28.270s)

modified libiptc with relative offset + correct_cache() (iptables-1.2.9)
	2m19.566s (1m52.510s/0m26.980s)

new rewritten libiptc2 (upcoming iptables-1.3.0)
	0m1.255s (0m1.205s/0m0.048s)

If you want to thank me for this speedup: Please do so by finding and
debugging the remaining issues:

TODO:
- implement TC_DELETE_ENTRY (should be fairly trivial)
- fix all the debugging/checking/dumping macros that I have disabled
- fix a race condition with rule_iterator_cur (already fixed with
  chain_iterator_cur, easy)
- find out why 'iptables -X' doesn't work yet
- verify that counter mapping really works in all obscure cases
- more testing
- find a theory why the system time decreased when modifications
  happened only in userspace code.. and getsockopt/setsockopt is still=20
  called the same way
- consume less memory: release (*handle)->entries after parsing

Thanks!

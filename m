Hi,
Where is the Callback function?
( You use it when you call "create_queue" ), w-hen you call
handle_packet() it executes the callback you supply in
"create_queue"..

And messages are removed from the queue only after you issue a verdict
for them. until you do they will eat up you're queue space :)

in order to fix the problem, create a callback ( "cb" is the name you
issued in the create_queue function ) and issue a verdict for the
messages you receive in that callback.

Kind Regards
Yechiel Levi

So, is the above doable in any shape or form or not?

Various reasons. Two common uses (at least in my case) would be to test 
ip range against quite a large set of registered subnets (taken from the 
geoip database and sorted using my own criteria). The tested ip range is 
either candidate to 1). ban that network, in which case I do not want 
duplicates if the existing range is already there; or 2) include the ip 
range in a separate set, making sure that it is not already in the 
'banned' set and also that it is not already included in the 'customer' 
set (which although limited, has quite significant number of set members 
- usually small subnets).

Because the ip range in ipset is not working correctly, I had to first 
manually go over the testing ranges. Later on I devised a small shell 
script doing what I just described in my previous post (quoted above), 
but it is quite ugly and inefficient - it would be much better if ip 
range testing in ipset was functioning properly, saving me all this hassle.

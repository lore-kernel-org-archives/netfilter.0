It is a bit of a workaround, that is true. But it is a workaround
that will fix the bug in every kernel since 2.6.32 (and perhaps
before - I haven't looked). It's thus reasonably easily applicable
to stable kernel series.

I'm not clued-up enough on Netfilter to know what the right fix is,
but is applying the workaround in a commit which could be easily
backported, then applying the 'right fix' (assuming that is different)
a reasonable strategy?

As you can probably tell, my interest here is to get something that
doesn't oops into stable kernels.

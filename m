Hello Harald & All,

Thanks for your reply. Eventhough I don't use NAT now, I will have to use it
soon. 

Connection setup really sucks after 'iptable_nat' module is inserted, my
Pentium-4 RH9.0 box hangs with 7Mbps traffic using 20,000 concurrent UDP
streams.

Are there any tweaks that I can do in NAT code to increase performance of
NAT, like: increase NAT hash-table size(I have got 1G RAM) or change hash
algorithm etc?. 

For e.g: based on a recommendation from netfilter FAQ, I passed an
odd-number(not a power of 2) as 'hashsize' parameter value  to
'ip_conntrack' module,  session-setup performance improved a lot after that
in my tests when UDP packet streams with incrementing source IP address are
sent. But this 'hashsize' tweak did not improve session-setup performance
when UDP streams with incrementing destination IP address are sent.

Is connection setup slow because of hash collisions i.e due to lot of
connections getting hashed to same hash-bucket? or it due to lot of
memcopies?. Can you please give some specific reasons for poor performance
of NAT, it will help me in optimizing/tuning, if possible, that specifc part
of netfilter nat functionality.

Thanks,
Kishore

yes, that's true.  I think we cannot state often enogh: DO NOT load
iptable_nat if you don't need nat.

NAT is inherently complex.  and in order to support any kind of nat,
every connection (even the non-nat'ed ones) need to be placed in two
additional hash tables.  

If you just use conntrack, a single hash table is sufficient..

There is no way to 'address' this issue other than not using NAT.

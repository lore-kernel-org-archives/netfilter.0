they are all the same, just synonyms.

yes, indeed.  After reading the ipv6 multicast code, I can confirm that
incoming MLD packets (e.g. queries from the network) are traversing
netfilter, but outgoing ones seem to be sent directly by net/ipv6/mcast.c

I really don't have the time to write a patch for this right now.  Could
you please enter it into our bugzilla.netfilter.org bugtracking system?
This way it [at least] cannot get lost.

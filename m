I was thinking on the overhead that this adds since we have to keep in
sync kernel and library header files. If there's some new feature in the
kernel, you'll have to wait until the new stuff in included in the
libmnl header.

But this is indeed a problem since people will report compilation problems.

I'll make a patch to add them.

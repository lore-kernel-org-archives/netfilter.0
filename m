Hm, 2.6.35 can lessen the maintenance burden compared to the currently 
minimal supported version 2.6.34, because the main trouble comes from the 
differences between .34 and .35. So I think I can remove the older kernel
supports gradually and keep supporting 2.6.35 for a while.

The problem with it that the reported number can be inaccurate, at least 
in two cases:

- Elements can time out, so even if whatever number reported, by the
  time it's displayed, the set can even be completely empty. In the case
  of a huge set, it can even occur that the number of elements reported
  does not match the actual number of elements listed.
- Sets can be updated by the SET target

The first one is the main reason I dropped reporting the number of 
elements (the initial design of the new ipset included it).

Best regards,

In ordert to cut the last ropes tying ipset to pom-ng, I added support to 
"patch" the kernel directly to the ipset package. 

So I have just released ipset-2.3.2a, which includes the required bits and 
files with and updated README file on how to compile modular and 
non-modular kernels with ipset support. Please give it a try and report me 
if something would be missing.

Best regards,

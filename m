I haven't seen the rest of this thread, so I may have missed something, 
but why are you doing DNAT on the nat OUTPUT chain? DNAT is usually done 
on the nat PREROUTING chain and SNAT on the POSTROUTING chain. Anything 
done in filter OUTPUT, mangle POSTROUTING, or nat POSTROUTING could 
change the direction of your packets before they leave your host.

This is _definitely_ not a netfilter issue then.  We are not doing
transparent proxying but nat.  netfilter/iptables _never_ accept
connections on their own.  So you open a connection:

1. telnet 10.0.0.1 5150
2. syn packet is sent by telnet
3. syn packet is DNAT'ed by netfilter
4. syn packet arrives at server application
5. syn/ack packet is sent by server application
6. syn/ack packet is SNAT'ed by netfilter
7. syn/ack packet is received by telnet
 [further handshake goes on]
x. telnet application prints 'Connection established' (connect(2) call
   returns)

This is a fundamental tcp/ip operation, and it can certainly by no way
be anything that netfilter does, that would introduce a behaviour like

1. telnet 10.0.01 5150
2. telnet shows 'connection established'
3. connection 'arrives' at server

[which is what you have been describing, If I understood you correctly].

Again, no way.  This seems to be some issue with your server
application. =20

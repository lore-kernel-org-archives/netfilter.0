Hi,

    I dont know what you mean by kernel thread ... but one solutuion is
that once you get the packet(inside your hook funcstion), have other
functions that you call from there to process the packet, and then finally
return NF_STOLEN. Or you can make an skbuff queue of yr own(a skb queue of
the module that you make), you can add the buffer to the queue, and return
NF_STOLEN, once you return NF_STOLEN control would return to your kernel
modulw only when you get the next packet, so you'll probably have to
process each packet as it comes and take whatever decision you want to then
and there. Look at the kernel source to see how TCP works, that would give
you a better idea.  As far as new packets are to be injected as done by
libnet, in kernel too you can easily make a packet of your own, but like
libnet there wont be anything to help you, and hence youll have to make the
packet yourself, that shldnt be difficult I believe. For a TCP packet for
example, fill the tcphdr struct yourself in a kernel module,attach an ip
header in front, allocate an skbuff, let skb->data point to the ipheader of
yr packet, then call "netif_rx"(or someother function exported by kernel),
that will again queue the new packet at IP,you will have to distinguish
between this packet and any packet that you did not generate because
otherwise  ull be caught in a loop, so use nfmark field of skbuff, set that
to a particular value then for that in yr hook function return NF_ACCEPT,
to let ti go its way, else process the packet.

Though doing this wont be trivial, it is not impossible either, it can be
done. do let me know how it goes if you try this and if you make netif_rx
work.

HTH
Amit

Hi Amit
thanks again. the last part is still not clear.
I want to know how can u send new packets in the kernel the
same way libnet does. The idea is that after i have returned
NF_STOLEN from inside my hook functions in the kernel modules,
i want to queue them toa kernel thread. the thread does processing
in its own manner and sends them out using some other mechanism. what is
that mechanism?? I hope u are understanding my point..

Hi Amit
thanks for ur prompt replies.
firstly from ur replies it seems
that
1: Whatever packets that i will construct using libnet or
   for that matter using ordinary bsd sockets would pass the
   relevant hooks in the netfilter based on the dest ip address
   i set. Is this true?? In this case i am constructing the packet
   completely on my own.
   >>> yes that is true, see netfilter hooks if you have read about them,
   catch ANY packet that passes thru the machines IP, be it raw packets
   that you inject using libnet(they are caught first by IP_LOCAL_OUT ..
   then they might hit other hooks), oor if they are coming from ethernet
   or any sort of mac layer(in this case caught first by PRE_ROUTING hook
   and then by others ) ...>>>>

Now what i want to do is steal(NF_STOLEN) packets at specific hooks
(generally pre routing)
within the netfilter and queue them to a user mode process.
The User mode process does some processing and either sends
the same packet or completely new and umpteen in number packets
at the post routing hook in netfilter(from ur answer using libnet).

>>> libnet is just one of the ways, you can use normal BSD sockets, or raw
sockets "any" packet that reaches IP wld be caught by the netfilter
hooks(provided you have registered your call back functions). For user
space queueing, better would be to return an NF_QUEUE, then use inbuilt
kernel module ip_queue.o and the user space library libipq. Once you return
NF_QUEUE and if ip_queue is already insmoded, your user level
applciationthat is doing a ipq_read()(a function call from library libipq),
wld get it, then you can play with the packet and return in without
problems .. read about libipq for this, if u jave iptables, then doing a
make install-devel in the directory where iptables asource is, wld install
libipq >>>>>>>


From ur answer it seems quite possible very easily. Correct
me if i am wrong here.
>>>>>
if you understand how ip_queue, libipq and libnet work it shld be fine ;-)

>>>>>

 Also is there any advantage of using
libnet over bsd sockets in terms of performance. Is there any
other performance optmized way of sending and receiving packets from
user to kernel mode?? Does netlink sockets way offer a more
optimized way of doing it?? (Sorry for a flurry of questions!!)

>>>>> ip_queue the kernel module i talk to and libipq use netlink sockets
to tarnsfer packets from kernel space to use space, if you want to transfer
new packets from user space to kernel space, i suggested libnet, you can
use normal raw sockets, bsd sockets, whatever you wish to >>>>>


Now the second part is what if i want to move it all to kernel mode for
performance reasons.
This means steal packet at pre_routing and then queue them all to
a kernel thread which was created using a kernel module. The kernel
thread then does some processing on the packets and then sends either
the captured packet or completely new packets out through the post routing
hook.
>>>>>>>>
yes it is possible, you can do it in kernel itself, performance wld
certainly be better but in that case maintenance/debugging might be a
problem, theres a trade off, you can make a kernel module which does all
the processing on the packets that netfilter hook functions capture,
depends on how complex you want that module to be.

>>>>>>
?

How can this be achieved??
>>> yes this can be achievded as above >>>>

Hi,

 You want to insert packets within the kernel module thta has netfilter
hooks ?, I dont thinkthat is a very good idea, as the packets u send using
a libnet application wld be caught at the netfilter hooks, if the
application resides on the same pc on which yr kernel module that has hook
funcstions resides, then those packets will traverse, local_out, post
routing, pre_routing, local_in etc based on their dest ip addresses, any
packet coming from ethernet wld traverse pre_routing, then local_in or
ip_forward and post_routing .....

Hi Akash
i know of this library.
But i want to inject packets at precise hooks
in the netfilter. for e.g. i want to inject packets whenever
the need arises ,at the fwding hook or the post routing hook. Will the
raw packets i send using the libnet get caught at hooks inserted using
netfilter at various points.

Hi,

  Try libnet for injecting new packets, you can use raw packets(u inject
from userland), libnet provides you with a better interface, but you wld
need root permission to use raw sockets. you can get libnet library from
packetfactory.net

Hi all,
I want to know how can we inject absolutely new packets at
various hook points in netfilter. I have already seen
some questions posted on this earlier too but no replies
as such. I am very eager to know about this because using
this we can construct some really cool stuff. Currently we
are undergoing a project on this and it would be of greate
help if somebody can find a solution to this.

Thanks in advance for any help on this.

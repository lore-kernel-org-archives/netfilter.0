I use full netlink messages with respect the buffers, taking into account 
the size of struct nlmsgerr in case of an error. If there was an error 
string, how much space should be reserved for that?

But why error codes looks complicated? Netlink already supports it and 
it's simple to separate them:
	errcode < 256	generic errors
256 <=	errcode < 512	generic netfilter specific errors
512 <=	errcode		table/match/module specific errors

An error pointer is required which points to the table/match/module, which
triggered the error.

Netlink based protocol is the path to internationalization. Netlink based 
protol leads to usable library. Library leads to gui. Gui leads to 
internationalization. ;-)

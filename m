Not directly related to this but I wanted to discuss this time ago. Now
that we have xt_CLUSTER I think that we can deprecate ipt_CLUSTERIP.

With regards to this issue, it seems arptables only support EUI-48 (6
bytes) for ethernet addresses, so xt_CLUSTER would inherit the same
problem but the point would be to fix arptables (not sure if possible
now without breaking ABI or adding some versioning like iptables).

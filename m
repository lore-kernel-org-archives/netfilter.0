iptables does not have any reasonable sense for load balancing. It is not 
what it is designed for.

Not the job of iptables, but there is plenty of other software doing this.

For the low-level load balancing look into Linux Virtual Server / IPVS. 
Standard part of the Linux kernel. For the host monitoring see LVS/IPVS 
related software (there is several good options).

Have played with implementing NAT based load balancing ontop of 
netfilter NAT. It is technically doable but is missing some small pieces 
of accounting to make it work in a nice manner.

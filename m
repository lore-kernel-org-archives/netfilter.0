As Thomas said, Netlink whatever protocol upon it, but I already told
you: making assumptions on the order of the attributes is not a good
practise because you'll have to stick to a certain message layout.

That's the opposite to what we aim which is to provide protocols that
can be easily extended in the future. If you assume that we cannot
change the attribute ordering, that's a rule that everybody will have to
live with forever.

Again, it will be valid, yes, but it's a poorly designed protocol.

Moreover, the reason why you want that attribute trailer is because of
the supposed-to-be limitations that you're trying to avoid. And, again,
I have to tell you that, avoiding the limitation by introducing
assumptions in the protocol is not a good idea.

http://www.hipac.org/documentation/user_guide.html states some
incompatibilities with iptables.

What's always resisted me from looking to it closely is that there is no
documentation about the implementation. I'm especially interested in how
the code deals with matches. The reason why counters aren't supported
interests me too, I can't see why adding 1 to a 64-bit integer would
result in a noticeable performance drop.
Also, is it not possible to make a B+ tree with the standard iptables? I
don't see why it shouldn't be possible. The jump to a new chain can be
seen as going deeper into the B+ tree. So it should be possible to
construct an iptables table structure that looks very similar to the B+
tree of nf-hipac, for some given rule set. I guess this will be somewhat
slower than nf-hipac, but I'd like to see the performance difference...

cheers,
Bart

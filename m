1) Get the kernel source code.

2) Get enough RAM to hold the full kernel source code, and your normal apps.
   To test whether you have enough RAM, use 'vmstat' to see whether you
   start swapping on this command:
	find /usr/src/linux -type f | grep -l 'struct ip_conntrack'

3) you are set up for work with the kernel. "grep for this" is the
   basic navigation aid. Now that you have found the include file
   (they end in '.h') where 'struct ip_conntrack' is defined,
   add the neccessary counter fields to it.

4) Study the other files the find/grep above found, especially the files
   with 'conntrack' in their names. Add the counter updates to the
   relevant files.

5) Provide ways for userlevel to access those counters. I would be
   interested to hear about the access methods you imagine.

6) Test. Test. Test.

> Any examples will be very helpful!

A concrete example, would mean writing the code. I hope you persist
and implement and share your code, because if you do, we will have
an example. I hope my six step program, above, helps you along a bit.

I'm sure that google has it indexed fully; use the advanced search
features, there, to restrict any search to a particular domain.
An example URL, searching for "byte counters" on www.netfilter.org,
would be:

	http://www.google.com/search?q=+site%3Awww.netfilter.org+byte+counters

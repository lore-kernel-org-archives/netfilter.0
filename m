I tried the debugging patch, but the "conntrackd -i" output wasn't
any different (no conntrack unique IDs).

All the events were listed above in order, so the last event on the
master ftp connection before the following DESTROY/UPDATE was the
UPDATE to the ESTABLISHED state.

Yes, I have nf_conntrack_tcp_loose set.

For whatever reason, I can't reproduce this anymore.  The expectations
now expire after the expected 5 minutes.  I'm not sure what's different
now.  If it happens again, I'll try and get more debugging info.

Yes, I was concentrating on the original example.

But if nf_conntrack_tcp_loose is disabled, then the conntrack entry is 
destroyed and the connection won't be "picked up" at seeing the normal 
packets after the bogus RST.

I do not think that it's a problem that an attacker can destroy conntrack 
entries by forged RST segments: it cannot be prevented. However the 
attacker *can* open up a new connection again and thus overcome the 
limitation of connlimit.

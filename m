As Arturo said, that's not yet implemented. I've been trying to find a
way which doesn't involve to store that comment string in the kernel,
given that this information is not used by the kernel in any way, but
all what I come out with was overly complicated and not nice.

So, assuming we store this comment string in kernel-space, I see
several possibilities at this moment:

* Add an expression for comments, which is sort of abuse since we'll
  iterate in nft_do_chain() over one expression which does nothing,
  so it adds some runtime overhead to the packet handling. This is
  what the iptables comment match current does, btw.

* Adding a comment field to nft_rule structure, which means that we
  have to consume a 4/8 extra bytes in the nft_rule structure for a
  feature that may not be used by everyone.

* Attach this this at the end of the expression data area (but *not*
  abusing the expression infrastructure). I think this has no runtime
  overhead and no extra memory consumption for those that don't need
  this comment feature, so it's the way to go IMO.

That's not yet support either. I think we'll need to keep some context
information in the batch handling so you can add several list after a
given handle.

- Our hard working tech committee has accepted another proposal. This
time veteran netdever Stephen Hemminger digs into the semantics of
names. Names have consequences he says.

Title: What's in a name?
---
Network device names have existed from the earliest days of Unix
networking and their usage has evolved. This talk is a look at some of
the issues with network device names. kernel developers often think the
problem is a userspace issue and nothing can be done but the names are
a key part of the existing ABI.

In the talk, I will cover how the choice of naming policy interacts
with applications and cloud environments, what current expectations
are, and how this interacts with cloud infrastructure. There is no
solution but there are several things that can be done to improve
the user experience. Will also give examples including Amazon, Azure,
Google Compute as well as other non-Linux environments.

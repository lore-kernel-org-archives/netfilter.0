That sounds just like xt2. Compatibility exists such that there is a 
defined mapping from xt1->xt2 rules (at one point I did write a 
setsockopt translator in the past...); the userspace tool mimics 
iptables in syntax, though I have allowed myself to not have certain 
options in the CLI tool. New framework, same thing, I guess. xt_core is 
independent of xt_nfnetlink and I do not see any hurdle in introducing 
new concepts if so desired.

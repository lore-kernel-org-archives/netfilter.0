I have installed a 2.4.23-pre5-x86_64-1 kernel on my Redhat Taroon Beta
Dual Opteron box, downloaded iptables-1.2.8, compiled it and it is
running without any problems.

Which distribution are you running?  Debian?  The Debian compiler
behaves inconsistent with all other x86_64 distributions wrt. 32/64bit
code generation - but this is a well-known and well-documented fact.=20

The reason why I haven't been considering ipset ready for kernel inclusion 
is actually simple: the current ipset framework is not flexible enough due 
to the rigid kernel<->userspace communication method and it does not 
support IPv6 at all. As I had expected to be ready with the next 
generation of ipset (codename nfset) more soon, I have been refraining to 
submit ipset for kernel inclusion. nfset is finally getting shape, by the 
end of summer it'll be released. So the reason not to submit ipset is 
stronger than ever.

In order to make life easier, as I apply the patches sent by Swen, 
there'll be a new, "standalone" version of ipset, i.e. it'll be possible 
to use it without patch-o-matic-ng.
 
Best regards,
Jozsef

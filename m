Hi,

I came across a problem with ICMP Unreachable Don't Fragment packages =
during the Path MTU discovery process on a linux software router which =
SNATs a small-MTU connected host to a larger-MTU network:


host A |--link A--| linux router |--link B--| host B
10.0.0.1       10.0.0.2       10.0.1.2     10.0.1.1


Link A has an MTU of 1400 (being a tunnel running PPP over L2TP over IP, =
that's why), Link B has an MTU of 1500. The router SNATs host A to its =
own interface address on link B, so that all connections to host B are =
seen as originating from the router.

When host B sends a return packet towards host A (like a response to a =
HTTP request), it can be up to 1500 bytes, which is too big for link A, =
it gets discarded by the router because the Dont Fragment flag is set. =
The router then informs host B of this by sending an ICMP Unreachable =
(Dont Fragment) packet and includes part of the dropped packet in this =
ICMP message, thus informing host B which packet has been dropped.

Unfortunataly, this part of the original packet shows the real IP of =
host A (10.0.0.1) and not the SNATed one (10.0.1.2) to which the =
original package has been sent. Obviously, the netfilter code un-SNATs =
the packet, so that it gets the 'real' IP of host A in order to be =
forwarded, then tries to send it, which fails, and now sends back the =
_un-SNATed_ packet portion. Consequently, host B discards this packet =
because it has never sent a package to the IP 10.0.0.1 reported in the =
ICMP error message.

SNATing in my setting is done via the usual POSTROUTING rule on the link =
B-interface of the router. Removing SNATing rules lets this setting work =
as expected, because the ICMP error messages now represent the actual =
network layout. Any TCPMSS tricks won't help either, simply because host =
A does not announce its MSS, and in fact announcing its MSS and =
discovering its MTU are two different things...

In order to have this kind of PMTU discovery working, the ICMP =
unreachable packets must represent the IP address of the SNAT-source =
interface. This could be either done a) by testing if a packet would =
have to be dropped due to DF contraints *before* mangling NAT IP =
addresses (which probably would break routing sementics), or b) by =
having some kind of ICMP NAT helper which mangles the reported IP =
addresses in the internet header payload of these packets.

Of course, this mangling would cause ICMP messages telling that you =
cannot send a packet to a host with this particular host's source =
address ("10.0.1.2 reports that a packet didn't reach 10.0.1.2 due to =
MTU and DF contraints"), which is kinda braindead and reflects the same =
dilemma as mentioned in ip_core_nat.c (having other host unreachable =
errors originating from the host reported unreachable), but then, NAT =
still is and always has been a hack and is partially braindead in =
itself...

Can anybody verify or falsify my observations? What do I miss? Is there =
a simple magic command line switch that makes this work and makes me =
look like an idiot? What can I do to solve this? Except writing some NAT =
helper for this? (Actually, I might try this if some networking jedis =
agree with me on the description of the problem... :)

Thanks for any comments!

Regards,

Oliver
P.S.: Oh, and please forgive me for using this broken mail client. If =
you cannot forgive, at least feel some amount of pity that I am forced =
to this stupid bloat thing instead of decent pine... Or mutt... Or =
elm... :)

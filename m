Call me stupid, but I couldn't figure out how to download the git branch
using git (when I did, I downloaded the 4.5 tree), but I did see it on
the web inferface. I downloaded today's snapshot from the git-5 branch;
I hope that's the same. I still get the same error however.

I've resolved the other issues I had: I should have thought of
installing the accompanying kernel header files.

I did this. The patch succeeded and compilation went, except for pkg.m4
which is easily resolved, without errors that I can see. I still get the
above results however.

NP. Thank you..

Its usually simpler to just run several instances of the same program,
easier to maintain/debug and avoids locking/race conditions...

If you have requirements that make this a bad choice (e.g. memory
usage), then yes, you can use threads.

See
http://git.breakpoint.cc/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=fw/afcd.git;a=blob;f=src/in/in_nl.c;h=e298bd073f3c7e0c62432510c2b3f7de953df1ec;hb=74a2df00cdee5f3ff8360b32d711d5db086b5355#l351

for a program that does this.

Yes.

I don't understand this part.  Basically all the processing do this
(see url above for full example):

 static int nfnl_queue_cb(struct nfq_q_handle *qh, struct nfgenmsg *nfmsg,
               struct nfq_data *nfa, void *data) {
        [..]
        ret = nfq_get_payload(nfa, &pkt);
	do_something(pkt);
        return nfq_set_verdict2( .. )
}

static void *_thread_main(void *arg) {
	[..]
        while (!thread_should_stop) {
                ssize_t rv = read(fd, buf, nfq_buf_len);
                if (rv > 0)
                        nfq_handle_packet(nfq_h, buf, (int) rv);
                else
                        /* error ... */
        }
	/* cleanup */
        return NULL;
}

All the threads then run nfnl_queue_cb() independently.
Of course, you'll need to add proper locking if they need to
access shared data structures...

2.6.24.3 includes a patches that was supposed to fix problems
with connections in TIME_WAIT state. Does 2.6.24.2 work better
for you?

Please enable conntrack logging for TCP by executing:

echo 6 >/proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_log_invalid

and check whether you get any messages in the ring buffer.

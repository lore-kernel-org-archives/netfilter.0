Subject: [PATCH] netfilter: NF_HOOK_COND has wrong conditional

The NF_HOOK_COND returns 0 when it shouldn't due to what I believe to be an
error in the code as the order of operations is not what was intended.  C will
evalutate == before =.  Which means ret is getting set to the bool result,
rather than the return value of the function call.  The code says

if (ret = function() == 1)
when it meant to say:
if ((ret = function()) == 1)

Normally the compiler would warn, but it doesn't notice it because its
a actually complex conditional and so the wrong code is wrapped in an explict
set of () [exactly what the compiler wants you to do if this was intentional].
Fixing this means that errors when netfilter denies a packet get propagated
back up the stack rather than lost.

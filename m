In the x_tables case it really caused a lot of unnecessary confusion,
the recent connection tracking changes however needed new config
options since we're keeping the old implementation around for a few more
releases. Unfortunately when switching between the two implementations,
Kconfig deselects all options depending on either one, even though the
dependencies are still fulfilled (f.e. NETFILTER_XT_MATCH_CONNTRACK:
depends on IP_NF_CONNTRACK || NF_CONNTRACK), which means you have
to select all those options again.

It probably won't be necessary anymore to make changes like this in
the future, but in case it is I'll make sure to at least provide
compatibility options for a few releases.

regarding the kernel panic on 3.2 a colleague of mine was using nmap with it's
heartbleed plugin

nmap --script ssl-heartbleed -sT -oX logfile.log 10.0.0.0/20

http://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/ssl-heartbleed.html

it took about 30 minutes to trigger the problem.

regarding the internal cache fill up. we have two routers and some vlans using
one and some vlans using the other router as the default gateway. 

this is the conntrackd config on both routers.

Sync {
        Mode FTFW {
                ResendQueueSize 131072
                ACKWindowSize 300
                DisableExternalCache On
        }
        UDP {
                IPv4_address 192.168.100.200
                IPv4_Destination_Address 192.168.100.100
                Port 3780
                Interface eth0
                Checksum on
        }
        Options {
                TCPWindowTracking On
        }
}

General {
        Nice -20

        HashSize 65536
        HashLimit 262144

        Syslog on
        LockFile /var/lock/conntrack.lock
        UNIX {
                Path /var/run/conntrackd.ctl
                Backlog 20
        }

        NetlinkBufferSize 2097152
        NetlinkBufferSizeMaxGrowth 8388608
        NetlinkEventsReliable On
        NetlinkOverrunResync Off

        Filter From Kernelspace {
                Address Ignore {
                        IPv4_address 127.0.0.1 # loopback
                }
        }
}

We have about 80 users, some of them running window or macs, so there is
plenty of multicasts and broadcasts that fill the conntrack table. some of
these then get stuck in the conntrackd internal cache. We can see the
LAST_ACK tcp states stuck in the internal cache as well, but I think these are
related to TCPWindowTracking On.

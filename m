Autoconf has its own pitfalls... I can't reproduce it so I added
'aclocal -I m4' to autogen.sh. After checking out the git tree, could you 
give it a try whether it solves the issue?

It's mentioned in the README file: you should simply re-run `configure'
with the additional flag '--disable-extra-flags' :-)

Your kernel header files at the default location is not recent enough.

I'm undecided yet how to solve it: maybe it should be checked by configure 
and fail immediately.

That's a possible solution but I'm uneasy about it.

The netlink.patch file must be applied against the kernel tree with which 
you compile ipset. That is in your case the kernel tree at 
/usr/local/src/kernel/linux-2.6.36.2.

Please read the README file: you must patch your kernel source with 
netlink.patch, compile and install it. Otherwise the new nfnetlink id 
won't handled by the kernel and thus ipset can't work.

Thanks for tests and the reporting!

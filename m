I agree to most of stuff that you have said but the above statement of
"port-restricted cone NAT" confuses me.
If we look at different types of NATs as mentioned here
www.crfreenet.org/~martin/referaty/stun/naty.pdf , i think the
netfilter implementation is really a symmetric NAT.
Iam I missing some thing?

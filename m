Hi,

Here comes ipset 6.6 with a couple of bugfixes and improvements. The terse 
list of the changes are:

Kernel part changes:
 - Use unified from/to address masking and check the usage
 - ip_set_flush returned -EPROTO instead of -IPSET_ERR_PROTOCOL, fixed
 - Take into account cidr value for the from address when creating the set
 - Adding ranges to hash types with timeout could still fail, fixed
 - Removed old, not used hashing method ip_set_chash
 - Remove variable 'ret' in type_pf_tdel(), which is set but not used
 - Use proper timeout parameter to jiffies conversion

Userspace changes:
 - Restore with bitmap:port and list:set types did not work, fixed
 - Accept "\r\n" terminated COMMIT command in restore files
 - Fix the message sequence number book-keeping
 - Protocol-level debugging support added
 - hash:net stress test in range notation added
 - ipset_mnl_query: in debug mode print the errno returned by the cb
   function
 - Accept "\r\n" terminated lines in restore files
 - Remove outdated checking of IPv6 support from configure.ac

I thank to Mr Dash Four for his tireless testings and helpful reports.

The next ipset package release will come with code simplifications, which 
mean dropping some support:

- iptree and iptreemap type support will be removed, because the automatic
  conversion to hash:ip is not fully backward compatible. The hash:ip and 
  hash:net types can be used instead.
- kernel version support below 2.6.37 will be dropped, to make code
  maintenance easier and more straightforward

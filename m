Fine by me, use yours.

Jesper Juhl was both pointed at the cocci docs and
given a cocci script.  He said he'd investigate it
when he could.  I trust he will get to it.

I think that for this sort of patchset, grep and
manual inspection works just as well as spatch
and likely better because a simple cocci script
doesn't transform code like:

	if (size > PAGE_SIZE)
		ptr = vmalloc(size);
	else
		ptr = kmalloc(size, GFP);
	if (ptr)
		memset(ptr, 0, size);

I did say in the 00 cover that this was broken up
just to cc the maintainers of each block.

I also think a single rolled-up single patch is good.

I believe Jiri Kosina can easily apply all these
individual patches as a single patch if he chooses.

It depends.

With MASQUERADE it's a port-restricted cone NAT.

Using the --random flag with SNAT you can almost create a symmetric NAT 
with netfilter, except that the "requirements" of the symmetric NAT (RFC 
3489) includes mapping to an unique source IP address and port whenever 
the same internal host connects to different external hosts. However 
netfilter creates an unique tuple (mapped src IP, mapped src port, dst IP, 
dst port) not just an unique pair of (mapped src IP, mapped src port).

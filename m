You are right, tcp/ip stacks are different. In this the difference shows=
 
case the filtered port will send back a host-unreachable while the close=
d 
port will send back a TCP-reset. It is best to always send back a TCP re=
set 
when rejecting tcp, all stacks react good to this (they better do, it's =
in 
the RFC). So add a --with-tcp-reset to jour reject and you should be OK.=

It's true that nftables suffered an hiatus in its development, but
we're back on it and there has been quite a lot of activity on it
recently. This is the kernel branch, you can check the changelog here:

http://1984.lsi.us.es/git/nf-next/log/?h=nf_tables8

And there's an iptables compatibility layer that is ready for IPv4,
you can find details here:

I understand you want to know more on the future of nftables, but
because the way I am, I prefer to skip "hot air" wording by now and
talk on code done anytime soon.

So I have to request some patience from you. We promise to deliver as
much information as possible once we are done with the core features.

Thanks.

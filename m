Getting trivial patches applied between the various
maintainers and the trivial tree is most often a bit
uncoordinated and haphazard.

Doing micropatches for each subsystem maintainer
does sometimes appear to be detrimental to getting
any treewide modification applied.

I've experimented with both micropatches and
treewide patches to gauge what happens.
I'm not sure either approach is better or worse.

In any case, it commonly takes several submittals
for these sort of trivial patches to get applied
either by the subtree maintainer or by Jiri.

Jiri often waits a few weeks for patches to get
picked up by any subtree maintainer before looking
at his trivial emails.  Sometimes he acks what's
left, sometimes what's left just disappears into
the ethervoid waiting for the submitter to try
again.

No worries, that's just the way it is.

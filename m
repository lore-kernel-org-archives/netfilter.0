Well yes, we have break at some point, but better if we break for
kernels before 2.6.34 than before 3.4 (CT.1 was added there) ;-).

So we're doing is just to trying to do our best to avoid the sure
breakage that will happen in upcoming 3.7 where NOTRACK will be gone.

There's only one single -stable branch that would break using recent
iptables + old kernel.

I'm mostly thinking of embedded people, that usually stick to really
old kernels.

I've been pretty happy with the script below and thought I'd share it.
I currently run this from rc.local.

It's written in lisp, which is my scripting language of choice, but
if you want to use some other language I hope it'll be easy enough
to translate.  If you want to use it as is and don't already have
clisp, it should be easy enough to download and install.
I suppose something similar could be done for http and perhaps
other services, but I currently use other approaches for those.

I actually run two versions, one for an older machine.  The
differences are that it reads /var/log/messages instead of secure
and that it uses "ipchains -A input -s ~a -j DENY" instead of 
"iptables -A INPUT -s ~a -j MIRROR".

The choice of mirror vs deny/drop is an interesting one.
I think mirror is justified by the fact that the attacking
IP address is evidently not spoofed (it has already managed to
send the right tcp sequence numbers several times).  
I've noticed that the ssh attacks in particular tend to stop 
after about 30 packets if you drop, whereas they sometimes go
on for thousands if you mirror.  While this may be viewed as
bad for the machine running the script (wasting its bandwidth)
I regard it as a public service to waste the time of attackers
who might otherwise be successfully attacking others.
Also, of course, there's some chance that the attacking machine
will break into itself, and might even do some damage, which I
would also view as a public service.

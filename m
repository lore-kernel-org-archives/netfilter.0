A couple of things that stand out after skimming through.

DSL - Jeesper's overhead as noted in the comments is not 5 and anyway I=
=20
think his good work has now been superseded by stab as it allows for=20
negative overheads, which his did not.

man tc-stab has clear and good explanations and examples.

SFQ - well it's literally been years since I knew it in detail, but=20
limit was (back then at least) for all flows combined.

I tested (maybe not hard enough) quantum < mtu and never managed to=20
prevent dequeues - I know it's not efficient and "forbiden" but back=20
then at least it didn't break.

Anyway it seems that early this year SFQ got some love and now has=20
several more options (red, headdrop, limit >127, depth as param) - so a=
s=20
long as your iproute/kernel is current have a look at man tc-sfq for=20
details.

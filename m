Hi,

after updating the production firewalls to handle the CW->CL state, I saw the
rate of drops decrease, but not as much as I would have expected it to.

I captured lots of data (/p/n/ip_conntrack, logs, tcpdump) and discovered
another problem with tcp_window_tracking that I could easily reproduce on
a lab : if a client reused a port too early, then the SYN/ACK from the
server was dropped, and the client could only connect after the next SYN
retransmit. I simply checked it with nc -p 1234 server 80. The first one
succeeds immediately, the second one needs 3 seconds to establish. There
is a logical explication to this :

The client completes a first connection to server:80 with spt=1234. A few
seconds later, he reuses the same port to initiate a new connection to the
server. The firewall still sees the connection in TIME_WAIT state, so its
state matrix switches it to SYN_SENT  (orig:sTW--(SY)-->sSS).

In ip_conntrack_proto_tcp.c:tcp_packet(), there is a test for this case. The
existing session is deleted and NF_REPEAT is returned so that the caller tries
again (here, ip_conntrack_core.c:ip_conntrack_in()). This one simply returns
the same code NF_REPEAT to its caller which will call it again (nf_iterate()).

The problem is that once ip_conntrack_in() is called again with the same pskb,
it already has its ->nfct filled, so ip_conntrack_in() immediately returns
NF_ACCEPT without doing any lookup. The result is that the SYN is passed to
the server, and the deleted session is not recreated. When the server replies
with a SYN/ACK, this one has no matching session it is blocked by the firewall
rules. Then, 3 seconds later, the client retransmits its SYN, which reaches
the firewall without any matching session, and correctly initiates a new one.

The solution is to correctly clear the ->nfct field in ip_conntrack_in() if
we return NF_REPEAT. This is what the following patch does. It's to be applied
to 2.4+POM-20030912, but I'm confident it may be easily applied and/or ported
to later versions.

I've not checked yet if the mainline conntrack code is also affected, but this
could be possible.

Regards,
Willy

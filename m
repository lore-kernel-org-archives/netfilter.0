When I wrote general error I meant the ones where there is no point (or 
cannot be) to specify the nature of the error exactly. Like in the 
example, ENOMEM: it's needles to report which new data field could not be 
allocated. But if the specified chain does not exists, that must not be 
masked by a general EINVAL. The user must be alerted that the chain with 
the given name does not exist.

Yes, use comprehensive error codes. And it's the responsibility of the 
userspace tool to translate them to proper error messages.

The former, i.e. error code.

For the clarity of the rules I'd prefer the current solution, i.e. check 
and enforce that the rule matches TCP SYN packets. If we relax it, next 
time someone could complain why TCPMSS is restricted to FORWARD, OUTPUT, 
POSTROUTING, why can't the system simply skip the target when called at 
non-appropriate hooks.

But I just picked TCPMSS target for errors which currently expressed 
in EINVAL.

I have got a three-level error coding in my mind: general, standard error 
codes (ENOMEM, EPERM, etc.), general netfilter specific ones (like 
NFXTE_HOOKMASK_NOT_ADHERED) and table/match/target specific ones.

But I do realize that it's much easier (and therefore quite tempting) to 
construct the full error message in kernel space and just send it back.
However, that'd make quite hard to support internationalization.

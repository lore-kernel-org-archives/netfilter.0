sure, we are constantly submitting patches to the 2.4.x and 2.5.x
kernels.

Which ones are you talking about?  2.5.x work is mostly eliminating
skb_linearize() from all parts of netfilter/iptables.  Apart from that,
almost all our patches are for 2.4.x

yes.  Th reason for not submitting it is not one of it being instable or
affecting too many other subsystems.  The main reasons are:

- still doesn't support multiple calls in one session
- some people seem to have DNAT problems
- it expands the ip_conntrack_tuple by at least 4 to 8 bytes, which
  is quite some penalty, considering there are two  tuples in every=20
  connection tracking entry

You cannot just put those two lines into the kernel, since they require
the respective header files.  And they increade the tuple size, see
above.

I can understand that position, but you have to understand that we have=20
different motivations for putting code into the linux kernel.

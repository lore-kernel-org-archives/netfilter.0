The idea is appending an error string is ok for Netlink as a protocol
(specification-wise), but the size constraints of the skbuffs in the
Linux may make its practical implementation a little harder. "Half of
the packet" is already used for the original request message, and
cramming an extra error string may bust the space.
It also does not look very netlinky to not use nlattrs ;-)

It's not like those strings change all that much.

Buying us what? If you change the string, but the gettext lookup is 
based upon a number, you will get an outdated translation, which is not 
nice either. IMHO: Better an English message than an inaccurate message.

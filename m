I'm not sure when that code was created but I don't think it was a fork=
=2E=20
I have no idea why they didn't mention this to the netfilter team, it=20
would have spared me the trouble. I received a mail from someone at=20
RedHat about their tool on 20/10/2003 and I pointed out the sourceforge=
=20
project ebtables where it's maintained. I didn't know they were still=20
using their own version...

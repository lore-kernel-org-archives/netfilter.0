I'll look into this, thanks.

Already made the hashsize the largest prime less than (524280 / 2), on=20

Well, not quite load balancing in that way.  I mean we have a whole mess of=
=20
systems 'behind' the routers, and we're splitting them up, so one router=20
takes portion A, the next takes portion B, etc.  I'm not actually load=20
balancing (ie. distributing between servers realtime), so much as splitting=
=20
the load across servers.

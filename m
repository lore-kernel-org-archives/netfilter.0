And I will get to look at cocci and spatch, they are definately tools that 
I want in my arsenal.

To be completely honest, I did get the feeling that the task I'd set for 
myself and was having fun doing in the little spare time I have got 
hijacked and I did waste about an hour and a half doing a few more 
cleanups before I saw the patchset on lkml.

But on the other hand, the most important thing is that it gets done, not 
who ends up doing it - especially since it's such a trivial cleanup, so I 
choose to see it as my initial patches just getting the ball rolling.

It would have been nice with at least an email along the lines of "I 
know how we can do all those patches in a jiffy, mind if I just go along 
and do that?", but I'll live. There's plenty of other stuff to do :-)

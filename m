Hi All,=20

Thought I'd make a small update on the iptables-tutorial since it's now
been longer than I originally anticipated for this release. I'm still
waiting for the first copy of the book to arrive, hence the delay.=20

I still have a few things to add to get up to 2.6.18 standards, but I
got (hopefully) 1-2 weeks before my personal deadline for the project.=20

Would anyone care to give any suggestions on things that are either more
important than the ones in the listed TODO, or that you believe should
be included?=20

Also, the book will be 'perfect bound' hard-cover, 9x6", and right now
is closing in on 400 pages, and that's where I hope it will stop for
now :-). The page count can go up/down pending any layout changes
however. It will run at 33-35 USD + shipping per copy.=20

Sidenote, the current french translation seems to be done directly from
the chunky html source, as noted in the TODO. Would anyone be willing to
make a change of this?

Also, basically all the translations needs to be updated if anyone feels
inclined...

The current changelog looks as follows:=20
1.2.2

* Added addrtype match.
* Added link to policy routing using linux by Matthew G. Marsh.

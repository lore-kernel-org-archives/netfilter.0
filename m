	What we see here is 120 seconds between 2680191 and
2680311. It can mean 2 things:

- some state timeout, it depends on your forwarding method.
What is it? NAT? DR?

- 60 seconds for ip_vs_conn_expire retries

	OK, this fix should make it safe for master-backup
sync and it should be applied but I suspect you are not
using sync, right? And then this fix will not solve the oops.

	There are no many places that rehash conn:

ip_vs_conn_fill_cport
	- used for FTP

ip_vs_check_template:
	- do you have persistence configured?

	After you provide details for the used forwarding
method, persistence and sync we should think how such races
with rehashing can lead to double hlist_del. May be
you can modify the debug message in ip_vs_conn_hash, so
that we can see cp->flags and ntohs of cp->cport, cp->dport
and cp->vport when oops happens again.

That won't go: tcp and udp are not the possible protocols alone, so by any 
reasonable syntax, '*' or 'all' should have to mean all protocols from 
/etc/protocols.

What I could come up as something similar in effect is to make possible to 
use a copy of /etc/services maintained by the administrator of the given 
ipset installation and whatever protocols and ports a service name is
resolved to from that file, use those.

However such a feature won't be added tomorrow. Nor this year (:-) or the 
very near future.

Yes, that's the reason for the expansion.

For the "net" (sub)type of sets the different prefixes in the set is 
recorded. When testing (adding/deleting) entries, the IP part of the entry 
is masked with the prefixes one by one and looked up until a match is 
found or the list is exhausted - that's why the speed is linearly slows 
down with the different number of prefixes added to the set. An example:

# ipset create test hash:net
# ipset add test 192.168.0.0/30
# ipset add test 192.168.1.0/24

There are two different prefixes in the set, 30, 24. So when the command 
is issued

# ipset test test 192.168.0.1

the address 192.168.0.1 is masked with /30 and the result is looked up 
and the match is reported:

192.168.0.1 is in set test.

If we want to test 192.168.1.1, then first it's masked with /30. Because 
there's no match, it's masked again by /24 then and now it's found:

root@teg:~/ipset/src# ./ipset test test 192.168.1.1                             
192.168.1.1 is in set test.

I never measured the speed difference between the two types. A good guess 
is that iptreemap is faster. However, the problem with iptree(map) is that 
it's susceptible when used as a container to block attackers dynamically 
by the SET target: it's trivial to mount an attack by which the worst tree 
structure is forced to be created. Therefore iptree(map) was dropped at
ipset-5.

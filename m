I'd like to add some more to this issue.

I did some more testing, and figured out the exact scenario that is causing=
 me=20
problems, here goes.

I have my router box, say, 192.168.0.1, and a range of IP's behind it, say,=
=20
10.0.0.0/24, for arguments sake.  I also have an application on the router=
=20
box listening on 100 ports, say, 5000-5100.  My uplink interface is eth0, a=
nd=20
the interface with all the 10.0.0.0 addresses is on eth1.

Now, I add an iptables rules something like the following:

iptbales -t nat -A PREROUTING -j REDIRECT -i eth0 -p tcp -d 10.0.0.0/24=20
=2D --destination-port 1025:65535 --to-ports 5000-5100

If I then telnet to 10.0.0.1 on port 5050, the connection is immediate, and=
 my=20
application receives a new connection on port 5050.  If, however, I telnet =
to=20
10.0.0.1 on port 5150, there is a small (but noticable) delay between when=
=20
the telnet session shows the connection as established, and when the=20
application receives the connection (on a random port between 5000 and 5100=
=20
inclusive).

=46irst, I cannot see why this delay is even there, choosing a random port=
=20
between 5000 and 5100 is not exactly an onerous task, especially not one th=
at=20
should cause a noticable delay.  And the connection itself is quite=20
responsive once established (closing it down takes no more time one way or=
=20
the other).

The problems really start when you multiply this out to enterprise proporti=
ons=20
=2D - I'm talking a system than can get thousands of new connections a seco=
nd=20
(the hardware is up to it, we're talking gb's of ram, and SMP machines).  A=
s=20
with my above small test case, connecting to a port in the 'to-ports' range=
=20
gives me an immediate connection (on the application), but the delay betwee=
n=20
telnet showing the connection established, and the application receiving th=
e=20
connection (and establishing it) grows dramaticaly, even taking over a minu=
te=20
for the application to receive the connection.  Hell, even the time for=20
telnet to show the connection as established is much greater when connectin=
g=20
to a port outside the 'to-ports' range than when connecting to one within=20
this range.

This is just an abserd delay, and I really can't see a logical reason that=
=20
this delay would be there.  Can anyone shed some light onto the situation,=
=20
and more importantly, how to fix it?  I'm willing to test some patches=20
(obviously in my test environment) to see if they resolve the problem as=20
necessary.

Thanks in advance for your help,

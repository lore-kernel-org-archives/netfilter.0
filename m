Hi!

The Netfilter project proudly presents:

        libmnl 1.0.3

libmnl is a minimalistic (really!) library that provides simple
abstractions to communicate using Netlink sockets.

If you're looking for a way to communicate some kernel subsystem and
user-space, Netlink provides a nice method to do so. For those not yet
familiar with Netlink, I suggest you to read:

http://1984.lsi.us.es/~pablo/docs/spae.pdf

This release include one fix and one new interface to allow to parse
messages from some payload offset, skipping the Netlink header. See
ChangeLog that comes attached to this email for more details.

You can download it from:

http://www.netfilter.org/projects/libmnl/downloads.html
ftp://ftp.netfilter.org/pub/libmnl/

Have fun!

Could you provide a binary tcpdump (-w file -s0) of registration
and a subsequent call please?

Yes, basically by default all connections would only have a single
tuplehash. The lookup would look up the tuple based on the packet
and, if not found, reverse it and retry the lookup. When the tuples are
asymetric (NAT and ICMP/ICMPv6) a second one would be added in the
ct_extend area and would be added to the hash table as usual. For the
SIP case, we could simply add a third one in a ct_extend area.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to find my old patch so far.

No good reason, other than I copied the code from elsewhere.
I'll fix both this and the code that I copied.

Again, I copied the code from elsewhere, where the wrappers did more.  As

side other bind and unbind calls. But if you have a strong aversion to them
then I am happy to remove these wrappers.

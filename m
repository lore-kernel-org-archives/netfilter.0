I do not follow. Conntract helpers can return NF_DROP to drop the packets, 
and this will cause the packet to be dropped. This is actively used today 
by the FTP helper when an partial request is received.

From ip_conntrack_in:

         if (ret != NF_DROP && ct->helper) {
                 ret = ct->helper->help(*pskb, ct, ctinfo);
 	[...]

 	return ret;
}

Setting the nfmark like this (MARK) should work, and should not panic your 
system.

In addition, setting the connection mark from helpers called in 
ip_conntrack_in should be available in all iptables chains.


All three of your problems makes no sense to me. All should work (return 
NF_DROP from helpers, setting the connection mark, setting the nfmark).

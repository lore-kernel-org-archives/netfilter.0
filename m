Thanks for testing and reporting back, I have pushed the patch to
master.

That's strange. Please, tell me if this happening in the primary
and/or the backup. If you are using the cache mode, also dump the
caches via -i and -e to see the content.

Expectations depends on the master conntrack, if the master is
released, the expectations will be released too. You may be noticing
that effect.

You can use `conntrack -E` and `conntrack -E exp` to verify this.

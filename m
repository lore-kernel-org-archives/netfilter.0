Yes, but at that stage it is not a network problem, only a badly designed 
application who do not shut down when the other end closes the connection.

CLOSE_WAIT is waiting for the local application to close the local end of

Yes. Or more realisticly reboot of the firewall/router or failover between 
two firewalls/routers not using ctsync.

I think you use call nf_ct_iterate_cleanup() to get rid of all GRE
conntrack entries that have a ct->master, which means that they were
created by PPTP. That implicitly calls gre_destroy, which releases the
keymap object.

No problem with that, we don't mind about out of tree modules. With
the approach I'm proposing I think you will also need to make this
function static as it won't be used by PPTP anymore.

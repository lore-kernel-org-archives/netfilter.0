I am currently creating a derivative of this module for a slightly 
different purpose. While testing that one and not using the -m state 
--state -NEW in front of the -m connlimit, I saw that that shortcut 
doesn't work properly but keeps on adding entries into the list. So, 
unfortunately I have to withdraw that patch. I apologize and I'll send a 
patch for this.

      Stefan

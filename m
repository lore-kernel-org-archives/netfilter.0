I cooked two patches on top of net-next-2.6 to solve the two last
race problems I am aware of.

Kapil, if you want to test them, make sure you take last net-next-2.6 s=
napshot.

=46irst patch changes __inet_hash_nolisten() and __inet6_hash()
to get a timewait parameter to be able to unhash it from ehash
at same time the new socket is inserted into ehash.

Second patch is a respin of the first patch I sent :
It makes sure __inet_has_connect() cannot give same timewait socket
to different threads.

Thanks !

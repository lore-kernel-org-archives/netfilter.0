The issue is related to the hash:net,iface type alone and only the 
interface part of the type: which interface is the "source" of the packet 
and which one is the "destination". (There's no problem whatsoevert to 
associate "src" and "dst" to the IP addresses/port/MAC of the packets.)

Maybe ASCII art helps better to explain the different views:

- Mr Dash Four

                     -----------
  pkt comes in ----- | machine | ----- pkt goes out
                   ^ ----------- ^
                 destination   source

- my view follows how the subsytem sees the interfaces

                             ------------------
  pkt comes in --- interface | ipset subsytem | interface --- pkt goes out
                           ^ ------------------ ^
                       source               destination

As we learned, the latter is wrong and inconsistent, moreover buggy.

"src" and "dst" are generic keywords of the set match and SET target of 
iptables/ip6tables and independent of the set types. The match and target 
have no idea what is "src" and "dst", the given set interprets them 
according to the type. 

Also, it is not possible to introduce alternate keywords just for the sake 
of the hash:net,iface, because ipset supports list of sets and in that 
case the underlying sub-types are practically unknown to the match/target 
(and additionally can be changed anytime).

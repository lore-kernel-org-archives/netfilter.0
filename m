Wishlist item:

In the future, I wish the indev/outdev were gone from the generic
iptables rule, replaced with exactly such a match as Jay is presenting.
Maybe it could be more "built in", and the old plain "-i" and "-o"
would work without saying "-m mdev", but nevertheless do exactly that
internally. That way we'd have full backward compatibility, and all
those rulesets out there without device matches, would certainly
operate two cache lines (P-III, i.e. 64 byte total) per rule faster.

best regards

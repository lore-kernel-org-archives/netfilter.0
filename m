yes, obviously it is.  Have you ever looked at the specification?

Also read Section 5 of
http://linux-igd.sourceforge.net/documentation.php

the problem is, that any email worm or whatever malicious current
windows virus might be active on one of the computers inside your
network can open _any_ port to _any_ machine via uPNP calls to your upnp
igd.

This is most likely my last message on this totally rediculous
mechanism.

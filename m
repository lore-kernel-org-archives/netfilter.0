I personally don't believe in this kind of 'security'.  The only way to
do this in a really secure way is to open a VPN tunnel to your firewall
and do the authentication related to the VPN protocol used.   Your
firewall ruleset can then have seperate rules for packets coming from
the VPN or packets outside of the VPN sessions.

Just because a particular proprietary vendor offers a 'feature', it
doesn't necessarrily mean that we need to do a blind copy of that
feature.

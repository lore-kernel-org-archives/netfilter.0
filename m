first, this is a development question.  Why don't you ask it on the
development list?

no, this is absolutely impossible.

yes. the tables are atomically replaced, and there is no functionality
for parsing/modifying the table inside the kernel.  All the kernel can
do is iterating them.

the only chance you have is to set up the nat binding by using
ip_conntrack_expect_related() - but you need to do that _before_ you
have received the first SYN packet.

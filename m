Sorry, I overlooked this email.

See nf_ip_hook_priorities:
http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/uapi/linux/netfilter_ipv4.h

See nf_ip6_hook_priorities:
http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/uapi/linux/netfilter_ipv6.h

Yes, I'm pointing to source code, I know I should not be doing this ;-)

Probably we can add the 'default' label, so:

        add chain x y { type filter hook input priority default\; }

In this case, default translates to 0.

        add chain x y { type nat hook prerouting priority default\; }

In this case this would be -100.

Then:

        add chain x y { type nat hook postrouting priority default\; }

This results in priority 100.

We would still need explicit labels though, eg. raw and security at
least. These are special type of filter chains.

Comments welcome. Thanks.

Hmm, why?

I don't understand why we need to change __nf_conntrack_confirm(), can
you elaborate?

At __nf_conntrack_confirm call time, only one cpu can see this nfct entry.
Other cpus on read-side can see it due to object re-use but any of the
following tests should fail:

1. different tuples
2. differnet zones
3. CONFIRMED not set

So they would skip entry and restart lookup (NULs value mismatch).

?

The conntrack is NOT in the hashtable at this point.  Its not even on
the unconfirmed list since we already removed it in preparation of
hashtable insertion.

That would be a bug, how can ->nfct be confirmed twice?

If you're talking about IPS_CONFIRMED getting set -- that should be
harmless.  In some theoretical condition we could indeed observe this
nfct on another cpu, just before we actually insert this but this does
not cause a problem on the read-side since the conntrack matches the
tuple exactly and all extensions have been initialized.

And if we create two conntracks with identical tuples on different CPUs
which is possible regardless of RCU this will be detected during
confirm step (we search ht for a colliding tuple).

So, if there is a problem please describe in more detail, I don't see
anything wrong so far.

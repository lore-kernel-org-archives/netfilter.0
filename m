Because that would still be employing VLAIS to solve the problem. The 
last element may be a zero-length array (a flexible member), not a VLA. 
Sadly both the last 2 elements in the struct need to be manually 
calculated, which is what we've done.

No one is claiming this patch is more readable, merely that it is C99 
compliant (though strictly speaking this patch is C89, C99 and C11 
compliant). We tried to use macros to make it more readable in previous 
patches. The consensus was that macros were bad.

That is what makes it "unreadable". :(

That is not necessary, because we already have ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4
in Makefile.am.

Since this popped up in another thread: 2.6.24 is the minimal version
for this.

And somehow, it feels like it would suck to add extra #ifndef-#define-#endif
to all projects (currently that would already be libmnl and ipset5)
just for CentOS.
If one does their own kernel, surely it's just a command away
from `make headers_install`.

A few years ago, I had a similar, though more extreme, issue as the
developer of pam_mount, redhat shipped some kernel 2.6, but headers
for 2.4. Tell ya _that_ sucks.

ipset could try using both nfnetlink and genetlink, in case
NFNL_SUBSYS_IPSET is not defined, couldn't it?

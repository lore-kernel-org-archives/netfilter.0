Hi Harald,

Just tested it on top of 2.4.25, like this :

    KERNEL_DIR=/usr/src/linux-2.4.25-pomng ./runme --batch extra

and I got a few problems :

  - first, I didn't find how to specify where my iptables sources is
    installed, so I had to enter it by hand each time I restarted it.
    I did not find any env variable in the perl code, and I must say
    that my understanding of perl is, hmmm.. very limited.
  - ROUTE and TRACE told me :
    "unable to find ladd slot in src /usr/src/linux-2.4.25-pomng/./net/ipv6/Makefile"
    I think they wanted to add a line in the Makefile but didn't find
    the right place to do so. BTW, is there a way to install a patch
    only for ipv4 or for ipv6 like before ?
  - I observed usual conflicts :
    present 'CONNMARK' conflicts with to-be-installed 'connbytes'
    present 'raw' conflicts with to-be-installed 'conntrack-seqfile'
    present 'CONNMARK' conflicts with to-be-installed 'conntrack_arefcount'
  - and finally, trying to apply conntrack_locking litterally killed my
    box in out of memory within a few tens of seconds (I could not even
    run ps) :
      Out of Memory: Killed process 9841 (runme).
      Out of Memory: Killed process 9970 (ps).
      Out of Memory: Killed process 159 (bash).
      Out of Memory: Killed process 158 (bash).

    Since conntrack_locking needs conntrack_arefcount which could not
    be applied, I wonder if there's some problem resolving dependancies.

I've not gone further yet.
Do you need more info ? There may be some things I did wrong, do not hesitate
to tell me ;-)

Cheers,
Willy

Well the DSL modem only transfers whatever data the ISP end sends to it,
which in your case is just PPP packets (LCC or LCP I think).  No one out
on the internet would be able to send ethernet data over the DSL link,
so the only way to send data to another machine on your network (that
the DSL modem is connected to physically) is if you have other machines
on your local network which are also running PPPoE and listening for
that traffic.

So the worst thing I can see happening is that someone on your local
network could potentially take over your PPPoE session, but that's about
it.  I just can't see anything else that could happen.  I used to run
exactly the setup you describe before I had to drop the DSL connection
(I moved).

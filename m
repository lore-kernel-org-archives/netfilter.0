Relying on the last ACK received from the other direction looks promising. 
We record the last (highest) ACK sent by both endpoints, which makes sure 
the packet they ack they did indeed received. And we accept a RST segment 
only if it's in the window we calculate (wider than the destination's) AND 
equal or higher than the saved last ACK from the other direction.

The only downside is that new fields must be added to struct ip_ct_tcp.

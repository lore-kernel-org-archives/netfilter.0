Hi!

The netfilter project proudly presents another development release of
the conntrack-tools. This release includes important updates, fixes and
improvements. Moreover, a new user manual has been released,
contributions to improve are welcome! Detailed changelog is attached.

What are the conntrack-tools?

- The userspace daemon so-called conntrackd that covers the specific
aspects of stateful Linux firewalls to enable high availability
solutions. It can be used as statistics collector of the firewall use as
well. The daemon is highly configurable and easily extensible.

- The command line interface (CLI) conntrack that provides an interface
to add, delete and update flow entries, list current active flows in
plain text/XML, current IPv4 NAT'ed flows, reset counters, and flush the
complete connection tracking table among many other.

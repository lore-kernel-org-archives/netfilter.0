Hi Florian!

I'm Cc'ing all the mailinglists in order to keep them posted about the
question you've raised there.  All further discussion will move to
netfilter-devel, so for those interested: Please continue there.

So It's clearly the connection tracking subsystem.  This is on one hand
good (because it means it's neither netfilter nor iptables). =20

On the other hand, this is definitely way worse than you would expect.
Can you please tell me more information about:

- number of connections you have? (cat /proc/net/ip_conntrack | wc -l)
- number of buckets and ip_conntrack_max (printed at ip_conntrack
  loadtime
- your traffic pattern.  Are you spraying udp packets with random
  src/dst? What kind of connections (protocol, application) are you
  testing with?
- what about the hardware (cpu, memory, smp?)

Even the worst tests we've had so far (random UDP packets) 'only'
reduced the througput by about 50%.   Maybe we can do better than 50%
worst case behaviour, but you will always observe a visible impact as
soon as you start connection tracking for every single packet (which is
what 'insmod ip_conntrack' implies).

Have you observed this behaviour with other kernel versions?  Was there
a performance change between 2.4 and 2.6?  Or did you always observe
this grave performance loss?

I've done an IPFIX implementation a few months ago for ulogd2, but it
currently is of prototype character only, as it only implements IPFIX
over UDP, but SCTP and possibly TCP (+ SSL) are required for a
conforming implementation.  I use the "bi-flow" approach of RFC 51303,
but it shouldn't be a problem at all to have it support the single
direction flow approach instead from RFC 5101/5102.

In general ctnetlink is not a problem here from a performance standpoint,
and I think there is no need for doing that in kernel space.

Some bits and pieces may be missing on the kernel side if you need to
classify your flows though.  E. g. some IPFIX Aggregrators require the
DSCP value for that.

I have setups with hundreds of thounsands of flows, and it accounts
quite well :).

Hope that helps a bit.

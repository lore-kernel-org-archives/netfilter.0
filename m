Landlock is designed to deny every access rights that are handled (by a 
ruleset) by default. All rules added to a ruleset are exceptions to 
allow a subset of the handled access rights on a specific object/port.

With the current networking code, a sandboxed process can still bind or 
connect to any port except, in this test, partially for two ports. This 
approach doesn't help to isolate a process from the network.

Right! That is how it should be.

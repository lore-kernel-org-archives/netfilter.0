	We found same problems triggered by IPVS during
subsys cleanup:

http://marc.info/?l=netfilter-devel&m=130765388528399&w=2

	It is a general problem for modules that register
callbacks to the netfilter core. nfnetlink is such example
with a mix of global (ctnl_notifier) and per-net (nfnetlink_net_ops) 
registrations. During net cleanup the module must be prepared
to be called by core because the core cleanup happens later.

	So, may be rcu_dereference under rcu lock is needed for
some functions (nfnetlink_has_listeners, nfnetlink_send) but
such changes should be audited by nfnetlink developers.
Using rcu_assign_pointer for net->nfnl without corresponding 
rcu_dereference looks like a problem.

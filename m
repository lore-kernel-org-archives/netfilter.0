Hmm, traffic sent between his machines would not go over the DSL since
the MAC address doesn't match the DSL modem (I would think so at
least).  It would be a mess if the DSL modem tried to forwards all
traffic on an ethernet segment (well it doesn't have the bandwidth for
sure).  Maybe I am incorrectly assuming the DSL modem only forwards the
PPPoE traffic being sent at it.  I could see broadcast traffic being
forwarded, although arps and such are generally not that interesting.

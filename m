The aliasing is already done in userspace. One types in "state" and it's 
converted into "conntrack" and that is then sent to the kernel. (So as far 
as I see if the ipt_state, etc module aliases were added to the conntrack 
module, even the state kernel module could be removed.)

However I suggest to delete the obsolete warnings completely from iptables 
and let these cases silently be handled as aliases.

Best regards,

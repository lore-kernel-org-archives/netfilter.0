They are different bridges, BR_GUEST and BR_INT, doesn't that mean it must
be forwarded?

Yes, but if the destination is a different bridge then isn't it passed up
to the IP layer without going through NF_BR_FORWARD, and so BRNF_BRIDGED
is never set?  And more importantly, nf_bridge->physoutdev is never set
until the output bridge processes it.

Conntrack does not deal with interfaces=C2=A0=E2=80=94 that is a routin=
g thing.
It would be perfectly valid to send an SNMP query out on eth0,
and receive the reply on eth1, while the re-reply goes out on eth2...

Hence conntrack only deals with <source address, destination address,
other bits like port numbers or for example ESP SPI indexes> tuples.
There is a dirty hack, which is skb->iif, but I would not rely on it.

TOS is not part of the unique tuple to identify a connection,
hence I do not think it should be used as such (though you are free
to do so, but I tell you, the result may not work).

Or you can=C2=A0=E2=80=94 but again it only makes sense for learning nf=
ct=C2=A0=E2=80=94
to force the same TOS bit on any connection (and if that is not
the case, drop it.)

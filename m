please read the netfilter-devel archive.  I get asked this question at
least ten times a week:

There is no pptp/gre conntrack and nat helper for 2.6.11+, since this
kernel version contains a redesigned infrastructure for such helpers.

At this time, I see very limited chance that this new infrastructure is
sufficient enough to actually implement the same functionality.  A
straight 1:1 port ist definitely not possible.

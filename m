Ok, let me try again then. We should merge xtables2, because
(some selected arguments follow):

 - It brings a NL-type (<- long-sought) interface

 - It uses a single table because there simply is no need
   to have multiple ones. This has benefits for replacement atomicity 
   guarantees, and gives some memory previously spent for modules
   back to the user, for example.

 - This table is NFPROTO_UNSPEC which means that the duplication of
   rules between ip(4)tables and ip6tables users had to make is
   gone, meaning less maintenance/complexity/etc. for the administrator, 
   and of course, less rules lead to less memory usage.

 - and because it retains some characteristics, for example
   atomic replaces and netns.

   Not everybody cares about these things, that would be unrealistic.
   However, some users, and me included, _do have_ an interest in having
   what is presented, because they do e.g. run containers. Otherwise,
   we would not be having netns in iptables today, right?

Now, don't dismiss these arguments.

The firewall rules appear to be different between the two systems,
the first one has a lot more references to the IPv4 conntrack module.

I'm mainly interested in one or more of the conntrack entries that
should get NATed but don't. One entry should be enough, feel free
to replace IPs as long as similar IPs still are similar.

Could you figure out whats causing the different amount of references
to nf_conntrack_ipv4? "-m state" rules, "-m conntrack" etc. take
references, maybe something fails during load?

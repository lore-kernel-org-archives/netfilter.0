	Can you try with recent ipvsadm from git:

git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/kernel/ipvsadm/ipvsadm.git

	I see related commit that will print -o for
the OPS feature:

    ipvsadm: Fix wrong format of -o option in FMT_RULE listing

    'ipvsadm -S' listed one-packet scheduling option in wrong format
    ('ops' instead of '--ops' or '-o') preventing any service with OPS
    feature from restoring using 'ipvsadm -R'.  Now we use '-o' which
    works well with save/restore commands.

	Let me know if you still have any problems with OPS.
Sending to lvs-devel@vger.kernel.org and
lvs-users@linuxvirtualserver.org should be enough for
ipvsadm related discussions.

	No kernel options should be related to OPS. I assume
you are not using the SH scheduler. Make sure the OPS mode
is properly applied to the virtual service, check for "ops"
in the configuration:

cat /proc/net/ip_vs

> Do I need to attach kernel config file?

	No

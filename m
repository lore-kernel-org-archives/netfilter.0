No, please don't "still". It implies "for a while, then it won't".

With passing one more internal flag, indicating that the "state" alias is 
used, the "conntrack" module can remain completely hidden and the user can 
list/save exactly the same command as the issued one.

I do not want to take away the "state" match at all from the users, and 
don't want it to be tainted by a warning either. This is a basic match 
used everywhere and there's no point in forcing everyone to use a new 
syntax.

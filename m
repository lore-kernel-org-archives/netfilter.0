That should not be a problem. However, what do we do with the general
kind of error that is overly general? A.k.a. the dreaded EINVAL.

Say a user requested jumping to a chain, but did not give a chain name.
Normally that would be EINVAL, but EINVAL is overused already.

What would you like? Comprehensive error numbers (sort of like the
ones Windows is said to use) aka. NFXTE_NO_CHAIN_NAME_GIVEN,
or a human-readable string; or something else?

NFXTE_HOOKMASK_NOT_ADHERED or string?

TCPMSS doing a rule-search for -p tcp is pretty ugly (it must understand
the data structures, and that is sort of a backwards shot); Patrick
once suggested IIRC that TCPMSS should just silently skip non-SYNs.

Maybe both error numbers, and providing extensions with the
possibility to send strings? It is impossible to provision error
numbers for out-of-tree extensions, so having a way for an extension
to return some NFXTA_ERRSTR "One of my parameters is wrong!" seems
required at least.

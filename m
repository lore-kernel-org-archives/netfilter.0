volatile is a construct from C-language standard and does not help that much
with syncing to CPUs.

(Specific for Intel processors, now)

If you read the beginning of Chapter 8
<http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-system-programming-manual-325384.pdf>

then lookup ticket spinlocks and then revisit the spin_lock implementation it
should get clear.

Have fun,

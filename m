gcc [long command line as spouted by make] -E mcast.c | grep '^#'

After hand-filtering, the apparent sequence is:

# 5 "../include/mcast.h" 2
# 1 "/usr/include/netinet/in.h" 1 3 4
# 1 "/usr/include/sys/socket.h" 1 3 4
# 31 "/usr/include/bits/socket.h" 2 3 4
# 1 "/usr/lib64/gcc/x86_64-suse-linux/4.3/include-fixed/limits.h" 1 3 4

so <limits.h> is included via <bits/socket.h> is included via <sys/socket.h>
etc. How is your stack trace?

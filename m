I'm not an expert in this interface, but what I've observed is when use=
r space reads a packet off of a socket to an NFQUEUE, a subsequent read=
 on that socket will block if the first packet is not returned via nfq_=
set_verdict(), even if further packets have been queued from the kernel=
=2E So I don't think you can expect to read a bunch of packets, concate=
nate them and then return verdicts on them. You'd never see packets pas=
t the first one. At least that's what I have observed. I haven't dug in=
to the kernel code to see if that is expected behavior.

I had written an application which poll()'ed on two fds; one a socket t=
o an NFQUEUE and another from signalfd() to SIGUSR1. The "handler" code=
 for the SIGUSR1 signal fd just printf()'ed some statistics maintained =
by the application. Funny thing was, if ever my application failed to c=
all nfq_set_verdict() for a packet read off of the socket, then poll() =
wouldn't return even when I sent the application a SIGUSR1 via kill. No=
t sure what was going on there.

Good luck,

Jeff Haran

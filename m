Hello,

I am currently using netfilter that comes with the Linux kernel 2.4.3.
I am not able to update to a newer kernel version because the platform
is an embedded device that has custom drivers specially created for
use with the 2.4.3 kernel.  I have observed two problems with MAC
address filtering:

(1) broadcast packets that go out from the device and then back in do
not contain a MAC address (according to log) and so fail the MAC check

(2) large packets (1536 on the wire) do not contain a MAC address (according to
log) and so fail the MAC check

I was wondering if there are known problems that I may be able to fix in my
version of netfilter.  I came across the MAC match bug that was exhibited
for really small packets, I am not sure if that could also apply to these 
problem.
I will give that a try next.  Please email your responses.  Thank you.

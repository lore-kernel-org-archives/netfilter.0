There's an upper layer netlink flag set (NLM_F_MULTI , NLMSG_DONE,
etc) that's usually used in NETLINK_ROUTE, etc.

Essentially, you set the MULTI flag on multi-part messages, and DONE
on the last one, clients are expected to collect and respond;

In those cases, the sequence number does NOT change intra-messageset
in my experience, instead it is assumed they may be received out of
order.

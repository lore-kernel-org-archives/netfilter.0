If you only need the distinction during local packet processing, then
you can use the nfmark field for that purpose. However, if you are
trying to mark packets that will leave the box and be destined for
another, then you can't use nfmark. nfmark is just a
netfilter-internal field used to mark packets for firewall/route
rule/traffic shaping classification during packet processing. That
field is not actually part of the packet that comes in/goes out on the
wire.

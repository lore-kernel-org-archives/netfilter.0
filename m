As Patrick said, that condition may change over time. I like to have al=

my ruleset loaded before the network is configured, even before some=20
interfaces exist. Your proposed change would prevent it. Besides, my=20
opinion is that it is not the job of iptables to do such checks.

This is wrong and inacurate. Using --physdev-out in the FORWARD and=20
POSTROUTING chains is supported for *bridged* traffic only, period. All=
=20
physical interfaces being members of the same bridge is not a sufficien=
t=20
condition to make sure that only bridged traffic will be matched.=20
Traffic can still be routed from a bridge to itself.

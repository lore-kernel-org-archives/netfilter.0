Thanks to all of you for such insightful replies.  As I synthesize them,
I see some problems and a possible solution.
1) Incrementing does create the possibility of routing loops although
this is minimal for end points.
2) Dropping packets with ttl < number_of_internal_hops may be safer but
requires a knowledge of the internal environment and incurs an overhead
with every internal change.
3) sysctl seems to provide no way to simply not send ttl expired
messages
4) If the goal is simply to hide the firewall, could one just drop all
packets where ttl == 1.  These packets would never make it only the
internal network anyway; it does not require incrementing ttl and 
requires no knowledge of the internal network.  I assume that, since one
can prevent the ttl expired from being sent by incrementing, that
netfilter will grab and drop the packet before the ttl expired
notification is sent.  Is there a problem with this approach?

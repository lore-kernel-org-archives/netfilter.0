This is a development question, please move this discussion to
netfilter-devel.  At least if you want to receive some reasonable
answers ;)

this sounds like the connection is not symmetrically.  The conntrack
core assumes that connections are always symmetrically:

request:
(srcip x, scrport a)  -> (dstip y, dstport b)

reply:
(srcip y, srcport b) -> (dstip x, dstport a)

If this is not the case, you are in serious trouble.

 	Yes, the difference is here, persistent services with fwmark 
ignore dest->port while non-persistent services with fwmark prefer
dest->port:

ip_vs_sched_persist:
         dport = ports[1];
         if (dport == svc->port && dest->port)
                 dport = dest->port;
 	- before the PE changes even dest->port=0 was selected
 	for non-fwmark

ip_vs_schedule:
 	dport set as: dest->port ? dest->port : pptr[1]

 	It is inconsistent. If we add new option for dest
it should have 3 states:

0: default (current, compatible)
1: prefer real server port
2: keep dport in packet

 	But the same can be done with rport or that was the
goal before:

- rport=0 (zero port) - keep dport from packet
- rport>0 - use this real server port

 	It works perfectly for ip_vs_schedule but not for
ip_vs_sched_persist, rport>0 is ignored for persistent
fwmark and this is wrong for NAT. Persistence should just
select dest but now it changes the rport semantic. The
right thing is ip_vs_sched_persist to work as ip_vs_schedule
but it can break some setups with persistence and fwmark.

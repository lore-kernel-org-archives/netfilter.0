Hi,

This error is kind of showing up alot in this mailing list.. ( I'd
love to hear a response about my  thought on how to solve those
re-occurring mail's, in the last paragraph ).

What's causing this error is that you do not handle packet's fast enoug=
h...
meaning that you're callback takes time to finish, therefor it delay
the recv functions.
The bufferspace that is filling up is actually the socket buffer.. the
fd you work the recv function on...
You can tune the socket buffer size, though it won't help because with
time you're buffer will fill up.
and as such you must handle you're packets asap, maybe in a different
thread( if you have multiple cpu's otherwise its kind of a waste).

I hope this mail will be available as an answer to everyone searching
this error on the web.. i know that when i looked for it, i found very
little information.

Maybe this information should be added to the doc's or maybe we could
create a Wiki for netfilter that will help newcomers and solve most of
those problems before they get to the mailing list, thus leaving the
mailing list for new issue's as they arise.


Kind Regards
Yechiel Levi

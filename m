Sounds a lot like something is happening to the FIN or RST packets: as
soon as conntrack sees a FIN or RST, it'll leave ESTABLISHED and
timeout fairly quickly.

Now, there are several simple things you can do here, as well as
dropping the ESTABLISHED timeout:

1) Try 2.4.21-rc5.  The hashing algorithm was markedly improved, which
   you could well be hitting.

2) You set the conntrack_max to 524280, but on a 1GB machine you'll
   only have about 8192 hash chains, making each chain 64 long.  Up
   the hashsize module parameter to around 100000 (or edit the kernel
   source if builtin, sorry).

There are certainly more intrusive measures we can investigate, too.

Um, how are you load balancing?  Remember, if the connection tracking
code doesn't see all the packets for a connection, it can't work.

Cheers,
Rusty.

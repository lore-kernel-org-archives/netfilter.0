Yes, tc-stab works with all qdiscs. Packet size is calculated  
everytime when qdisc_enqueue() is called and qdisc has size-table set.  
When none of qdiscs has size-table, packet size ends up being same as  
skb->len. So if leaf has size-table, that takes preference over  
earlier parent size-tables.

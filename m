That's entirely possible and I suppose it's the same pitfall I fell in
when compiling libmnl. :-/ I installed kernel 2.6.36.2 but didn't copy
it's header files into /usr/include, where ipset would pick them up.
Since I have no intention to go back to 2.6.18, I'm going to copy the
header files and try everything again to see what happens.

I suppose you shouldn't do anything (yet?) because of the above.


Thanks,

first, i thought or assumed what you said like above is from the
reason that NAT mapping is first started from L3 IP connection mapping
[origin and expect tuples..] and from TCP helper [for TCP port
infomation ..etc] but it is not based on TCP contents.
so you said it is not possible to rediect such connection.
is it right?

and second,
i think some people might also want such a functionality like what i
want to do,
redirection some connection to other server judging from its TCP
contents infomation.
[in this case, the URI  infomation of the HTTP transaction]
i want to know how you think about ..

previously thanks ~

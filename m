I had a thought about this, and I see a lot of work taking this
approach.

How about this:

Write a jump target that applies only inside the filter table, since the
first revision would just implement filtering control.

The module itself would be initialized by a userspace tool be adding
rules. An example would be:

iptables -I INPUT -m expire --expire-condition timer=3D6000 --expire-id
12123124325 --source 192.168.1.1/24 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I OUTPUT -m expire --expire-condition timer=3D6000 --expire-id
12123124326 --destination 192.168.1.1/24 -j ACCEPT

Since they are inserted in these tables, they should be called before
ESTABLISHED,RELATED is even hit.

The jump determines if the packets are valid any longer. The problems
that I can see here are:

- The rule itself needs to be cleared out of the chain once it is
expired. I could get the daemon to do some housekeeping, but it'd be
better if the jump module could clean up its own reference. Can this be
done?

- The CONNTRACK entries for the allowed sessions are not dropped. Once
again, it would be nice if the jump module could clean up the CONNTRACK
entry.

My humble suggestion would be that this should be handled in the
stateful
connection tracking - If a session is authenticated and certain
connections
are to be allowed, then the new allowed connections would be of state=20
"related".  Really handy would be the ability to distinguish these
particular
'related' connections and feed them through specific chains.  I for one=20
would NOT want to simply open the box (or network) wide for every
authenticated=20
connection, but would like to be able to specify a different set of
(more=20
permissive) rules for them once authenticated.  Perhaps patch an
additional
state - "PAM" or "AUTH".  Or the ability to specify a fwmark that is
automatically implemented for RELATED traffic to the authenticated
session,
allowing different chains to be traversed based on the mark found.

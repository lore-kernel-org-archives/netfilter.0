Guess its  the timer in the ecache extension (with LOCKDEP on probably).

I'll submit a patch to get rid of that shortly.

I think your patch is fine because the 'no timer
in ecache extension' change is quite large, needs review/stress testing
etc and is inapropriate for stable tree anyway.

ecache is 24 bytes without that timer, should be < 256 in total for
all extensions.

I think BUILD_BUG_ON test would be nice.

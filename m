The plan, as posted last fall[1], is to continue generalizing the 
different iptables copies into one, bringing Xtables up to the next 
level, e.g. family-agnostic rulesets, while retaining 
compatibility.

The "when" originally was 2.6.32, but I got a little slacky in doing 
requested benchmarks, so it had practically postponed itself to the 
current cycle, 2.6.35. If my counting is right, ~41 patches of that 
list[1] have been merged, and while doing that, 46 concurrent 
commits/ideas of mine have also been merged.

There are at least 60 patches left however, and that does not include 
any comments from your side. I guess I don't get to spool and flush the 
entire queue to 2.6.35 anymore - "better luck next time", or?

Will revisit.

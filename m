It's been while I looked at the linklayer/size-table code, but if I  
remember right overhead is calculated with first linklayer packet sees  
in qdisc. So when packet goes to leaf with 'linklayer atm', packet get  
packet size with overhead for ATM and root linklayer is not used for  
that packet. Because of this you can have leafs with different  
overheads (pppoe, ipv6-tunnel, etc, with ) and all get right  
overhead... ..

..

...Uh oh...

HTB still has linklayer/overhead of its own, I was talking about the  
generic linklayer code that can be used with all qdiscs. Never mind,  
sorry.

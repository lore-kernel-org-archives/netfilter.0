According to the explanations in nftables wifi:
https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Performing_Network_Address_Translation_(NAT)

You should add the following nft rules(I agree this is tricky and
unfriendly for the end user):
# nft add chain nat prerouting { type nat hook prerouting priority 0 \; }

But unfortunately,  even if you add the above rule, you will still fail to
connect to a local server.

Now add another nft rules listed below, you can probably make everything
work fine:
# nft add chain nat output { type nat hook output priority 0 \; }

[ cc netfilter-dev group ]

For loopback connection, the request packets will traverse:
OUTPUT->POSTROUTING->PREROUTING->INPUT
and the source ip will be modified in nat POSTROUTING hook.

Meanwhile the reply packets will also traverse:
OUTPUT->POSTROUTING->PREROUTING->INPUT
and if nat OUTPUT hook exist, the destination ip will be modified
in it, and re-route will happen. Otherwise, the destination ip will
be modified at nat PREROUTING hook, and the dst entry will
be dropped. In such situation(i.e. nat OUTPUT doesn't exist),
we will try to do routing lookup and packets will be dropped
at ip_route_input_slow->martian_destination.

Furthermore, if ipt_rpfilter is configured, the reply packet maybe
dropped at there.

In iptables, nat output chain always exists, so there's no
such problem.

But I think that enforcing the user to add a nat output chain
in nftables is not a good idea, so probably we need a following
patch(I only list the ipv4 part):

sorry, i didn't mean it that way -- just suggesting that, if one
selects to do basic filtering, a sub-option of "connection tracking"
means that they want to do *additional* filtering.  but there would
still have to be a top-level connection tracking option.  this just
gets messy with these interdependencies.  yuck.

i agree.  see above.  i'll give all of this more thought, and peruse
the actual code more carefully to see how all of this ties together.

Between command-line stuff for users/administrators and the kernel hack=
ing bits on linux-net, etc. I'd like to see a middle ground: i.e. bette=
r documentation about the C API to userspace from the kernel routing me=
chanisms.

Better documentation about rtnetlink would be appreciated, and maybe th=
e low-level libraries that run atop that as well, such as libmnl.

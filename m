Resending as plain text.

Yes, iptables so misbehaves here. I know you agree about not causing
the connectivity issues, but don't you agree that the wrong rewrite
shouldn't happen? For both iptables and nftables?

I already use oif to restrict the masquerade, I'm not trying to solve
it for myself, because I already have a working workaround. I'm trying
to help reporting and resolving a bug.

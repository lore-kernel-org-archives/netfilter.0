Why not use nlattr to encode the error string? It would make error
messages easier to extend in the future. At some point we might want
to add an offset field which points into the original netlink message
describing the attribute which caused the failure.

Thinking of netlink protocols in general and netfilter in specific,
maintaining a list of reserved error codes for each subsystem/target/
module will result in an unbearable pain if the error codes are not
separated into individual namespaces for each module.

That would in turn require each module to define a unique number or
some form of namespace resolution mechanism which does not help to keep
things simple.

This is the main reason why I advocate the use of error strings.

Do we *really* need internationalization for error messages on this
level? Primarily userspace should be in charge of checking for all kinds
of erroneous user input and produce meaningful context based,
translatable error messages. Error messages produced by the kernel
should be the exception and not a substitute for proper userspace error
handling.

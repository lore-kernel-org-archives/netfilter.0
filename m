Pablo,

I tried to debug this a bit and added some printk()s in the 
ctnetlink_create_conntrack() function to find out where the ENOMEM is coming 
from:
So, now I see that nf_conntrack_alloc() is not returning this error, but it is 
coming from a couple of lines below in the same function:

        helper = nf_ct_helper_find_get(rtuple);
        if (helper) {
                help = nf_ct_helper_ext_add(ct, GFP_KERNEL);
                if (help == NULL) {
                        nf_ct_helper_put(helper);
                        err = -ENOMEM;
                        goto err;
                }

There, nf_ct_helper_ext_add() returns NULL, which causes ENOMEM to be 
returned.

I didn't debug this further because I'm rather lost in the code. But maybe 
this gives you some hint what's wrong.

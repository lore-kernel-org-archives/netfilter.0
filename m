Anthony & All,
Earlier when I checked, /proc/net/ip_conntrack  and /proc/slabinfo were both
showing a number around 34000 to 36000, when I checked again after sometime,
number of connections in /proc/slabinfo hit the maximum 131072 and number of
connections went down to 20 to 30 in /proc/net/ip_conntrack andbox is
rejecting new connections.
Thanks,
Kishore

I can understand why you think this might be the magic number causing the 
problem, but why would Kishore be running into this limit with only 20 to 30

connections active on the machine?

Now that we've dealt with the logging issue we can concentrate on the
above suggestion that tries to avoid using a spinlock.  It works well
in packet mode but not so much in byte mode.

Whether working in byte or packet mode the solution is using packets
to determine who will send the notification.  When dealing with bytes
identifying which packet made the byte count go over quota is of prime
importance.  The problem is that the upgrade of packet and bytes in
"nfnl_acct_update()" is not atomic to the caller - there is always a
possibility that the thread will lose the CPU between incrementing
packet and bytes.  This could eventually lead to erroneous arithmetic
and an imprecise recognition of a quota attainment.

No matter how I turn things around in my head we need a spinlock -
either in nfnl_acct_update() or in the match function of xt_nfacct.c.

Comments are welcomed.

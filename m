Hi there,

Currently running 2.4.35.1 patched for ipsets by hand using the old
POM sources.  No problems with that at all.

Using fresh kernel 2.36.6 source and the ipsets source download from
http://ipset.netfilter.org/ I can't seem to get past this failure to
build the kernel, no matter how I permute the building and patching
instructions, although I've put no time into actually debugging it:

ip_set.c: In function `ip_set_register_set_type':
ip_set.c:329: parse error before ',' token
ip_set.c: In function `ip_set_create':
ip_set.c:840: parse error before ',' token

make[1]: Leaving directory `/mnt/hde3/gwh/src/linux/linux-2.4.36.6/net'

Just a heads up, as far as I'm concerned this isn't an urgent issue. :)

Send TCP reset if you wish to get immediate response.

TCP/IP stacks which interrupt connection attempts on ICMP
host-unreachable are broken implementations. ICMP messages are
advisory and insecure. The message shown, host unreachable, is merely
advisory - the actual thing the machine is telling you is that the
connection timed out and that in _addition_ a host unreachable message
was received during the timeout which might very well be related, but
which is not definitive.

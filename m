OK, just to be sure, I just installed kernel 2.4.21-rc6, with all the=20
'pending' patches applied to it as well, these are the ONLY patches applied=
=20
to this kernel.

Netstat is showing me the following connection breakdowns:
SNATs: 0
ESTABLISHED : 1060
LAST_ACK    : 4865
TIME_WAIT   : 29
=46IN_WAIT2   : 1
=46IN_WAIT1   : 39
SYN_RECV    : 3277
LISTEN      : 100
CLOSE_WAIT  : 9261

/proc/ip_conntrack, however, is showing me the following:
CLOSE: 176
CLOSE_WAIT: 111
ESTABLISHED: 9046
=46IN_WAIT: 8634
SYN_RECV: 134
SYN_SENT: 25111
TIME_WAIT: 2165
(no state): 128

Remember, the *ONLY* natting this machine is (or should be) doing is=20
re-directing any new TCP connection bound for (remote_range) port range=20
1025-65535, to a local port range of about 100 ports (using REDIR, I used t=
o=20
use DNAT, same difference though).  So the above counts seem very wrong to=
=20
me.  And although the established count is very high, the SYN_SENT count is=
=20
astronomical.

There are also, as you see above, 128 conntrack entries without a state, wh=
ich=20
by the look of it, are UDP connections.  I'm not even natting anything for=
=20
UDP.  WTF is going on here?

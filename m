Can we allocate conntrack with zero ct_general.use and increment it at
the first time before inserting the conntrack into the hash table?
When conntrack is allocated it is attached exclusively to one skb.
It must be destroyed with skb, if it has not been confirmed, so we
don't need refcnt on this stage.

I found only one place, where a reference counter of unconfirmed
conntract can incremented. It's ctnetlink_dump_table(). Probably we
can find a way, how to fix it.

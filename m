Can I ask one of the maintainers to have a quick look at this please? 
The code is simple to understand and the mofications self contained.  
We missed the 3.14 merge window, it would be very disappointing to
miss the next one.

This is the second version of the feature rebased on the 3.13 kernel - all
comments from the maintainer have been followed except for the removal of
a spinlock that protects the integrity of an internal accounting structure.

I have sent a scenario for the output path that explains the concequence of
not having the structure guarded by said spinlock but received no answer.

As such I am sending this second version with all comments addressed less
the spinlock removal in the hope of getting more feedback on the matter.

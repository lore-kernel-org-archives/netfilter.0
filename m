In the input and forwarding path, packets run in bh context, so that
won't happen.  That may only happen in the output path in process
context. However, I don't understand how this may lead to "erroneous
arithmetic" in the "quota attainment" yet, you have to elaborate your
concerns/scenario more specifically.

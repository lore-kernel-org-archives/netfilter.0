Have you considered updating the NETMAP target inside the linux
kernel instead?

Your idea looks interesting in that I could envision it superseding
DNAT, SNAT and NETMAP altogether.

It would be nice if you could

 * resolve the inconsistencies in indentation. Specifically, use tabs to 
indent statements. If in doubt, use scripts/Lindent 
and scripts/checkpatch.pl from linux.

 * wrap lines at 80 cols in xt_DNETMAP.man 


Things I have noticed while spending a quick look:

The manpage mentions "If host 192.168.0.10 generates some traffic, it 
gets bound to first free IP in subnet - 20.0.0.0.". However,
20.0.0.0 can be a network address and thus lead to problems.
Is there a way for the user to specify that the range to use
should be 20.0.0.1-20.255.255.254 rather than 20.0.0.0-20.255.255.255?

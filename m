When using a brouter, you actually assign IP addresses to the bridge 
ports (different subnets) instead of the virtual bridge interface 
itself. IP traffic is then DROPped in the BROUTE chain, so it's not 
bridged. See http://ebtables.sourceforge.net/examples/real.html#example1 
for an example usage.

I've read Vyatta site before VC6 was released :)
This is a ULOG-based solution or not?

Thank you for pointing it out, I didn't know about conntrack support in ulogd.

As far as I understood, IPFIX output in ulogd is in a early stage and
don't work. So, I tested ulogd + ctnetlink with null output and it
worked very well.
CPU load was about 5-10%, and it's just nothing on this router.
However, I'm not sure that output is correct and all flows was
accounted. I also don't know what is about active and inactive
timeouts in this approach.
I'll look to ulogd_inpflow_NFCT more closely.

Patrick, decision is to optimize ctnetlink and not to make accounting
in the kernel space?

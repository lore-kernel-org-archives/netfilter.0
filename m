Nope, I haven't thought about it. It's doable. Classic NETMAP
functionality could be available through some rule option.

Thanks :-).

Will do.

Usage of network and broadcast addresses for NAT shouldn't pose
any kind of problems. I tested such setups in my networks. If you use
classic NETMAP to map wider address space to shorter one, you can also
have flows NATed to network and broadcast address of subnet specified
as a parameter of the NETMAP rule.

Not yet, but module option could do a trick as long as it's really
necessary.

After adding printing of the conflicting intervals, I was able to find 
and resolve several of them as they were "permanent" subsets of 
"blackhole" net blocks.

Unfortunately, the last of the occurrences I located breaks the logic of 
the configuration files

I define, in one file, the IP addresses associated with various 
interfaces, attached networks, and "interesting" hosts. The intent is 
that if network numbering or topology changes, I modify *one* file and 
the changes flow through.

In particular, at one point in the rule set, I drop all packets that are 
not destined for one of:
* Addresses of a specific interface
* A directly attached network
* A specific service host

     ip daddr != {$interface_addresses, $attached_network_addresses, 
$service_host_address} drop

Clear, concise, easy to maintain -- or was

It now fails if the service host happens to be on the directly attached 
network, which it won't always be.

Removing $service_host_address breaks the one-point-configuration paradigm.


At least as presently implemented and unless overlapping ranges are 
permitted, sets, both implicit and explicit, have become an 
"anti-feature" for me.

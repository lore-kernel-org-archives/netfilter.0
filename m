You can implement this with nftables. Actually, nftables allows you to
have as many tables as you want. No matter what configuration you
select, it's extremely flexible.

Once single table means no table at all to me. We have also planned
adding agnostic tables to avoid the IPv4/IPv6 cases.

Again, those are completely possible with nftables.

So far, I haven't see any *strong reason* to drop nftables code and
write something from scratch as flexible as it is, my impression is
that you don't know how nftables is designed and it works, so you'll
have to tell me why I'm wrong.

As said, please provide convincing arguments, no more rants.

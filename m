It is not a change of the actual code, it's just a different formatting
for the patch.  And as you want to get it into the mainline kernel, you
will have to submit it to the netfilter maintainer(s), which is the
netfilter coreteam (us).

And we prefer patch-o-matic format, since this is the opportunity to
have the code being tested for some time, until we conclude that it is
safe to submit it to the mainline kernel.

Of course you are free to submit in any form, it would just make our
work easier if it was p-o-m.  I think we already receive 95% of the
contributions in this format.

yes, indeed :)

The algorithm does not allow to ignore the protocol part. That's the 
reason why double lookup would be needed if such syntactic sugar as 
'tcpudp' were introduced. Lets assume we store in the artifical set above 
two elements:

192.168.0.1,tcpudp:53
192.168.0.1,tcp:80

Now, assuming that first 'tcpudp' is looked up, to match the first 
element, we need one lookup. To check the existence of the second element, 
we have to use two lookups: first with '192.168.0.1,tcpudp:80' (nomatch),
then with '192.168.0.1,tcp:80'. And to check the existence of any 
non-matching element (say 192.168.0.1,udp:123) needs again two lookups.

Such a hack thus would penalize the normal cases.

If you need to match the same port both with TCP and UDP, then add it 
to the set twice, with the proper protocols.

Yes, therfore my assumption was that the ports are uniform, identical for 
all elements.

DHCP uses UDP only. VPN (e.g OpenVPN) can be configured to use UDP or TCP, 
but not both at the same time. For ipset point of view, IPSec is an 
independent (actually, two, AH and ESP) protocol. Kerberos uses a couple 
of TCP and UDP ports, but not both with the same port number (except for 
changing password under Windows, if you have to support both the old and 
new interfaces).

STUN uses a single port over TCP and UDP. RTP may run over TCP but the 
majority of the applications uses UDP only. SIP is complex... IRC uses TCP 
only.

LDAP and *SQL use TCP only.

Yes, currently there are some negligible differences. Most of them can be=20

Yes, that is true and a big problem.
There are a lot of people that think that nf-HIPAC would rearrange the rule=
s=20
in some user-defined chains. But that is completely wrong. Nf-HiPAC used a=
=20
completely different approach. The rules are translated into a very efficie=
nt=20
data structure that does not have anything to do with iptables'=20
representation of rules in tables and chains.
I really need to add some documention about the algorithmic approach.=20

It does make a difference, because it means a write to an otherwise complet=
ely=20
read-only ruleset.=20
But independent from that, the netfilter developers agree that it is a bad=
=20
approach to have counters enabled by default for each and every rule=20
(refering to last years netfilter workshop). Future versions of iptables (o=
r=20
successors of iptables) won't come with counters enabled by default on all=
=20
rules.

It is very easy to add support for counters to nf-HiPAC. Just write an=20
iptables match or target for it.

Sorry, but you seem to confuse some things.
nf-HiPAC is not based on B+trees or any other kind of B-trees.=20
nf-HiPAC does not rearrange the rules in some custom userdefined chains in=
=20
order to achieve better performance.
Instead nf-HiPAC translates the iptables representation of tables and chain=
s=20
into a completely different data structure that is much more efficient.

And, trust me, the lookup data structure used in nf-HiPAC will be much fast=
er=20
than anything you can construct based on iptables and user-defined chains.

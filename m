Yes, I know. Still I had a little hope that that'd fix the issue.
Do you have another idea? Should for example /usr/share/aclocal/pkg.m4 be 
unconditionally copied into m4/ by autogen.sh?

Yes, exactly. I'm going to add checks to configure so it'll fail if the 
definitions are missing from the header file. Also, I'll add just the 
compiler warning flags which are supported by the actual compiler and thus
--disable-extra-flags can be eliminated.

Yes, it could. It's unfortunate that old ipset modules could be compiled 
without any kernel patching while new one needs it. But we are on the 
right track: Dave accepted my jhash.h patch in net-next-2.6 and as it is 
propagated into Patrick's tree, I'll be able to submit the ipset 5.x 
kernel patches. But there's no need to rush: I hope I can get feedback 
from other architectures, like Sparc or ARM too. (On Wednesday I'll be 
able to dust off a Sparc machine and run the compilation and testsuite.)

Best regards,
Jozsef

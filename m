	You can go off _on_ a distro, you really can.
Yes indeed.

(a) the iptables userspace package uses _init

(b) xtables is a generic term for protocol-independent code/components

(c) xtables-addons's kernel parts are based on an unmodified kernel 
source.

(d) xtables-addons's userspace parts are based on an unmodified iptables 
source.

Not only did RedHat manage to blow up on (c) for RHEL5/CentOS because of 
excessive backporting, but now they also crippled their iptables 
package with that nf_ext_init, breaking ALL extensions out there.

I wonder how they managed to not break the compilation of the
extensions inside the iptables package -- because these continue to
use _init and its substitution was just nuked by that patch.

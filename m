Oh there is:

	echo "- 2001:db8::1" >/proc/net/xt_recent/foo

	echo "/" >/proc/net/xt_recent/foo

it is.

Entries do not expire (except "falling off" the LRU when it's full) -
there is no counter that tells them when they expired.
"--seconds" is just a match option, not something that defines
the LRU's properties. And that's actually good, because that allows
you to write

	-m recent --name foo --seconds 60 -j do that

	-m recent --name foo --seconds 3600 -j do something else

If you purged "expired" entries after 60 secs, there would be nothing
left for the 3600 one to check for.

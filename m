What you want is to redirect an existing connection to a new destination.
If you use TCP protocol, the only way to do that is to record the current
connection and, in parralel, create a second connection to you new
destination and replay the payload on the packet in the new one.

If you use UDP, this doesn't apply since there's no connection tracking in
the UDP protocol. Netfilter, however, does some connection tracking on UDP
packets, so make some test to see if it's doable.

I had to solve the same problem in a honeypot project to redirect active
connections from low interaction honeypots to high interactions honeypots.
The solution I choosed was to queue the connections in userland using
netfilter_queue, process them and replay those I've selected to the new
destination in parrallel, and then drop the packet from the initial
connection.

It's tricky to do, and there's many issue to solve, but AFAIK this is the
most reliable solution.

Note : window-tracking is for the tracking of the window size in the tcp
header, it has nothing to do with this.

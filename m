I'm currently travelling, I'll look into it tomorrow. Just one

The local ICMP tracking is basically useless nowadays since we always
manually attach the conntrack reference from the original packet
(exactly because of the half-done double NAT FIXME quoted above).
But this is an interesting case, the connection tracking code itself
thought the RST was invalid, but ICMP tracking will still associate
the ICMP containing the RST with the original connection. I'm wondering
whether it should really do that. In case it shouldn't, just removing
all locally generated ICMP special-casing should also fix the bug,
right?

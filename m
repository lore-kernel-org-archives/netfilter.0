Of course the protocol number is stored and not the string.

You constantly ignore the difference between xtables and xtables-addons...

No, there's no point to store start-end ranges: the network address and 
the prefix is stored, which thus require less memory compared to the 
range.

Yes, that's it.

No, there's no such weakness in the hash or bitmap types.

The attacker cannot guess the initial parameter of the hash types, so even 
if he/she knew the hash size, cannot figure out what addresses to send in 
order to create clashing entries in the hash. The initial parameter is 
even not saved when saving a set, so if you save a hash type of set, 
destroy and then restore it, the set won't be expressed by the same hash 
structure as the original one because the initial parameter is internal 
and created random.

Of course, it's absolutely possible. However in order to slow down for 
example ssh scanning, even short time blocking of the addresses from 
which scanning is detected can be quite useful.

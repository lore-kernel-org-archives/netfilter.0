Hi, I can tell that IMQ is proving to be much more stable then it was 
suppoed to be on january when we got the project up again after being 
unmantained for some time. Users mailling list has more then 200 people 
now and many of then, including me, using IMQ on heavy traffic gateways 
without problems.

You just should avoid modules on 2.6 series. There is a reported issue 
with iptraf on 2.6 too (it stops counters, not the traffic), nothing 
serious.

A new version is about to be released for <=2.6.7 with new features like 
choose number of devices, choosing "where" it hooks and some others.

Dinil, I would like to ask you to report your issue with iptables to the 
IMQ list or directly to me so we can investigate what went wrong and, if 
needed, find a solution.

Tks

Andre

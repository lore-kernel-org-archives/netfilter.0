The scenario:
I have a DSL modem in pass through (bridge) mode. The linux firewall/router 
has a single ethernet card.  It is running pppoe. This gives two interfaces: 
eth0 and ppp0. The firewall is running iptables. There are several machines 
behind the firewall.

Problem:
I've been told that if someone whose public IP address is on the same
network subnet as mine were to get my mac address, (s)he could bypass
the firewall and talk directly to the machines behind it.

Is this true?

Thanks.


I code, therefore I am

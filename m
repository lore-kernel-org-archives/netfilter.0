I think you could emulate full-cone NAT that way. But of course it is not 
a viable solution in practice because every rule has to be set up in 
advance and one can't handle all hosts behind the firewall.

As soon as you want to deal with more than one host behind the firewall, 
you'll hit the *practical* problem of clashing (the issue which is simply 
ignored in those BEHAVE RFCs). And because you haven't got as many IP 
addresses at the external side of the firewall as inside to map the 
internal addesses to (that is the very reason why NAT was needed), 
clashing will happen.

Application developers would do much more good for themselves by designing 
their applications with IPv6 support and clearly declaring: "Hey, if you 
have got IPv6 connectivity, you get the full power of the application, 
otherwise you may have to live with limitations, when being behind NAT." 
That way they could help in backing and spreading IPv6.

Please note, we (where I mean the whole Internet) are already too late in 
the transition to IPv6 - the IPv4 address space will have been depleted 
sooner than IPv6 will be deployed everywhere. And the "solutions" for the 
interregnum when there won't be allocatable IPv4 addresses and IPv6 is 
still not there everywhere are worse and worse. Which one would like to 
choose anyone?:

- Multilevel NATs at the ISPs (how will any NAT traversal cope with 
  *that*?)
- Much more stronger binding to the ISP - newcomers are forced to use
  the servers of the ISP to run any of their public services
- IPv4 address market (which is limited to the regions, otherwise the core 
  routers won't be able to cope with the inflation of the routing tables)

Don't need to pick: any or all of them will come, because we are too late. 
So in order to *minimize* the damage, everyone should work on the 
transition to IPv6 and not waste time on "fixing" the unfixable NAT.

I'd be glad to see some summary on your findings with other NAT 
implementations.

I suspect Pablo didn't change it already for a good reason and as such
reluctant to do the modification myself.

An object that has reached it's quota can always be reset from the
userspace with:

$ nfacct get object_name reset

As such we need to reset the flag so that a broadcast isn't sent.

Here "info" is an object seen and shared by all processors.  If a
process looses the CPU between the two atomic64_read, other CPUs in
the system can grab "info" and go through the same code, leading to an
erroneous count of byte and packets.

To me the real problem is with the incrementation of "pkts" and
"bytes" in function "nfnl_acct_update" - there is simply no way to
prevent a process from loosing the CPU between the two incrementation.
 I've been assured this can't happen on the INPUT and FORWARD path but
still waiting an answer on my scenario for the OUTPUT path.  If it
wasn't for that I think there is a way to remove the utilisation of
the spinlock.

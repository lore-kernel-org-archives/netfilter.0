yes, most people will use a stable kernel rather than a development one
;)

true.

I haven't investigated the new in-kernel ESP implementation that far,
but your observation sounds reasonable (although I don't say this is the
desired behaviour).

Because NF_IP_LOCAL_IN (like all other hooks) are in the layer 3 stack,
and decapsulating ESP is inside a layer 4 protocol - thus it happens
after the ip stack has handed it over to the esp4 protocol engine.

no. My preferred solution was something like adding a netfilter hook to
the xfrm4 engine, exactly after decapsulation / decryption of one layer,
i.e.  after xfrm_type.input was called.=20

iptables could then register the INPUT chain (or probably even a
seperate POSTXFRM chain) in order to filter on the respective packets.

yes, this is why this should be discussed on the netdev list (Cc'ed).

I think this needs to be sorted out before 2.6.0-final will be released.

Any comments are appreciated.

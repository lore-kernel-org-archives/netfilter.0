I agree, error strings don't look like a viable solution to me,
they are basically impossible to interpret by an application,
you run into localization issues and so on.

I'd suggest to return an errno value and the attribute causing
the error, possibly also the value (we append the original message
anyways, but in case of lists it might be hard to locate the specific
attribute). The harder cases are when a combination of multiple
attributes are responsible for the error, but still, the application
has to understand the kernel interpretation anyways, so I'd simply
return the errno and all attributes responsible. Leave interpretation
up to userspace.

Forget about strings, any error returned by the kernel should not only
be suitable for interpretation by a human, but also by an application.

IFF we're recycling the exact same tuple (i.e., flow was destroyed/terminated
AND has been re-created in identical fashion on another cpu)
AND it is not yet confirmed (ie. its not in hash table any more but in
unconfirmed list) then, yes, I think you're right.

Right, since a new conntrack entry is not supposed to be in the hash
table.

Perhaps this needs additional !nf_ct_is_confirmed()?

It would cover your case (found a recycled element that has been put on
the unconfirmed list (refcnt already set to 1, ct->tuple is set) on another cpu,
extensions possibly not yet fully initialised), and the same tuple).

A few weeks ago I posted to these list reporting a similar problem, however
on Linux 2.6. The problem I had (and still have) is that when I have
ip_conntrack enabled on a router I lose memory over time. An extreme
example: a flood ping with packets of size 64K over this router results in
a memory leak of about 10MB per second. The problem did only occur if
packets larger than MTU size were sent, which looks like there is a
problem in ip_conntrack reassembly (possibly refcounting for slab objects ?).
The behaviour of the slab cache is exactly the same as you described it.

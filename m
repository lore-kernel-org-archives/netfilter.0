But as said above, I need a seperate 2nd set anyway,
to be able to see the hardcore attackers.
For example for auto-generating and filing
an Abuse Report to the abuse-address (WHOIS)
of the owning ISP of that attacker/hacker IP.

Your other suggestions make sense, indeed, but ATM
are too advanced for me; I would need some time to
learn these advanced concepts possible in current nftables.
In the meantime iptables with ipset shall suffice for my non-HA needs.  :-)

Thx.

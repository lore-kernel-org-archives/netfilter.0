Agreed. The text-based interface seems to me like yet-another-interface
that users may (ab)use (like /proc/net/nf_conntrack, I have seen people
polling from it to display information, this was OK in the early days).
Following this basis, one may come and implement another text-based
interface to display the rule-set in the kernel and so on.

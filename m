Justin,

Is you're recv error(-1) print's : bufferspace unavailable?  If so,
the problem is not with the tcp sequence, and the multiple tcp
sessions, it is again with the face that you're process take's alot of
time..
I don't recommend using more threads than you're cpu count, and
ofcourse try using a thread pool..
 (If someone has better knowledge of schedulers in userland, please
input here ).

even if you are dispatching the packet to a different thread to work /
queue .( as in thread pool ), maybe the throughput you are getting is
way over you're processing capability.
(Also, if anyone was successful in doing deep processing on packets
with libnetfilter_queue, and was successful in outstanding big
throughputs, you're input will be appreciated here )

If you want, you can increase the buffer space size, and i said in my
previous mail, but it will not solve the issue, since over time / more
tcp sessions, even that buffer will fill up. Increasing the buffer can
be done via: "nfnl_rcvbufsiz(nfq_nfnlh(my_nfq_handle),
NFQ_NF_BUFSIZE);" ..

NOTE: if you write to hdd while processing, don't / use an advanced
flushing method's in order to avoid writing to disk so much... for
example try using syslog... )

Kind regards
Yechiel Levi.

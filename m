Hi,
we had a minor emergency here last week, so I wasn't able to test the=20
old kernel. I'll see that I'll try that tomorrow.

Ok, I'll send one along later today.

There are at least two devices between the communication partners: a DS=
L=20
modem and a firewall on the remote end (outside of my control). Both=20
devices have been there already and didn't create any problems with the=
=20
old iptables setup. The only thing that changed on that communication=20
path is the firewall hardware, the NIC on the firewall and the=20
netfilter/iptables version used by the firewall.

Sven

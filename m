	Excellent!

	Harald, I'd be honored to!
	With the help of http://www.stearns.org/html2sgml :-), I've got 
that article in sgml form, ready to go.  Fabrice, I've patched against 
your 1.30 Netfilter-extensions-HOWTO.  Here are the files of interest:

http://www.stearns.org/patches/netfilter-extensions-HOWTO.1.31.sgml

	The howto with my text merged in.

http://www.stearns.org/patches/netfilter-extensions-HOWTO.1.31.html

	The above .sgml, converted to a single file html to see how it 
looks.

http://www.stearns.org/patches/netfilter-extensions-HOWTO.1.30-1.31.patch

	The diff against 1.30.

	Please let me know if there are problems or if I should provide it 
in a different form.  Thanks again to everyone for your help.
	Cheers,
	- Bill

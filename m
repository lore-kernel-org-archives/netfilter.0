Hi everyone,


Xtables-addons 1.5.4 has been released; highlights of this release are 
the import, cleanup/bugfixing the "condition" and "ipp2p" matches and 
additionally extending the "IPMARK" by IPv6. I hope people don't mind, 
but I have not heard back so far, so I take it it's ok.
LOGMARK (for analyzing packet marks and connection states) now prints 
the invoking hook and the packet direction. There is now also a compiled 
manpage that lists all matches' and targets' options, plus a few fixes 
to the TEE target.

that's it for now, have fun,

  About Xtables-addons.
      Xtables-addons is the proclaimed successor to patch-o-matic(-ng). 
Likewise, it contains extensions that were not accepted in the main 
iptables package [so far].
Xtables-addons is different from patch-o-matic in that you do not have
to patch or recompile the kernel. [Supported kernels versions are 
2.6.18--2.6.25;; not all p-o-matic patches can be transformed.]
A big benefit of the compat layer of xtables-addons is that the actual 
modules remain largely free of #ifdef hackery and hence make maintenance 
a lot easier.

I hope, but still one cannot be sure.

We call the unified part of iptables and ip6tables to xtables and it's in 
the "iptables" package which has never included ipset (except the 
userspace match/target interfaces).

The "xtables-addons" package is the successor of patch-o-matic-ng for 
extensions which are not (yet) accepted in netfilter and Jan included 
ipset into it.

So please take the trouble and use the correct term.

The IP address and the prefix is stored. Which can easily be converted 
into a range anytime.

Leaving out the range stuff, more-or-less yes. In order to test an 
element:

1. The IP address is masked with the first prefix from the list of
   prefixes in the set.
2. The resulted address and prefix are hashed; or if it's a hash:net,port 
   type, then the resulted address, prefix, protocol number and port 
   number are hashed
3. The hash slot is looked up and searched for a matching entry
4. If there's no match, then (virtually) shift off the first prefix from 
   the list of the prefixes and goto 1.
5. If there's a match then report success. If the list of prefixes is
   empty, report failure.

Different methods give different results depending on what you measure: 
insert element, delete, lookup, lookup non-matching entry, memory usage. 
Have a look at Rusty Russell's hash comparisons:
http://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=94. The measuring of the previous hashing 
method in ipset 5.x can be found here: 
http://www.kfki.hu/~kadlec/sw/netfilter/hash/. The current one was also 
compared to other algorithms but I haven't had time yet to write the 
summary.

I'm looking forward to see your results.

Best regards,
Jozsef

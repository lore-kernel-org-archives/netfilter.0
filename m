Yechiel,

Again thank you this seems like a better fix than ignoring the error.
I had set the queue length to 1024 so it makes sense that the
buffersize would also need to be adjusted to acomidate the new queue
length.  I have not figured out how to access the error message along
with the error number so I dont know for sure what it was.  Its
probably safe to guess that because I was using the default buffer
space it was "bufferspace unavailible".

#define BUFSIZE 4096 // Size of buffer used to store IP packets.
#define NFQLENGTH 1024 // Length of the netfilter queue.

nfnl_rcvbufsiz(nfq_nfnlh(h), NFQLENGTH * BUFSIZE);

So yes the kernel is sending packets to the queue faster than my
application was processing them but I expected that.  The buffer does
need to be adjusted so the queue can hold those packets until they can
be processed.  A single session did not run into this issue because
the default buffer size is large enough to hold any outstanding
packets of a single session but once multiple sessions were involved
the queue would fill up quickly.

After that change I was able to handle running 32 parallel iperf
connections.  The total throughput was ~20Mb.  Without sending traffic
through my application the throughput was ~138Mb but given that all my
test systems are running as VMs on the same system with only 4GB of
ram it does not supprise me to see a big hit in performance there.
Should see better results running on dedicated hardware.

Thanks,
Justin.

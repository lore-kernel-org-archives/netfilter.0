Then your matching algorithm is wrong!

Using your example above, I'd add the following change: the protocol 
specifier could be converted (internally) to a number: 1 - tcp (1 in 
binary form), 2 - udp (10 in binary form), 3 - 'tcp and udp' (11 in 
binary form). When you need to match against a real protocol (which, if 
I am not mistaken, can only be either tcp or udp), then you can use 
binary 'and' operation (&) with one simple statement to determine 
whether there is a match. Using your example above, we will have the 
following (internal) representation:

192.168.0.1,3,53
192.168.0.1,1,80

Thus, to check for 192.168.0.1:53 (tcp) - there will be a match as when 
you apply 1) ip match; and 2) protocol match - i.e. 1 & 3 (1 & 11) you 
will get >0, therefore protocol matches; and 3) port match, there is a 
match on all 3 elements, hence return a complete match. Just one lookup 
needed.

When you have 192.168.0.1:53 (udp) the situation is exactly the same as 
far as the protocol goes - 2 & 3 (10 & 11) you will get > 0, hence there 
is a match again. Just one lookup needed.

When you have 192.168.0.1:80 (tcp) - you will have a match on the ip and 
protocol, bit mismatch on the port, so no match - you also need one lookup.

You have exactly the same scenario with 192.168.0.1:123 (udp) - match on 
the ip and protocol part, but mismatch on the port, so no match!

There is no need for a 'hack' just sensible and efficient programming, 
that's all.

I've already dealt with this - I do not see the need to add 2x as many 
elements to a set when, in reality, I am not interested in matching the 
protocol part.

An isolated case and one which does not apply to a common scenario.

You are mistaken - DHCPv6 (client as well as server configurations) uses 
both TCP and UDP protocols on the same port numbers.

You are assuming that I will have a single machine on which VPN is 
running, which, again, is an isolated case. When I have a central hub, 
which controls multiple subnets VPN packets can originate from (or be 
destined to) the same port numbers using TCP as well as UDP protocols.

Again, not true and you are assuming I am running a single machine - 
that is not the case at all.

Kerberos remote login, change password (except klogin which uses tcp 
only), administration and kreg can all be ran using either tcp or udp on 
the same port numbers. As for IPSec - the situation is exactly the same 
- port 1293 with either tcp or udp utilised.

Yep, that's right - both protocols could be used on the same port.

Again, utilising TCP is not as uncommon as you might think - TCP gives 
you better line quality when you have good (optical for example) network 
and it is also the preferred option when you utilise encrypted data 
streams. Same goes for SIP.

IRC on Port 194, protocols could be either TCP or UDP, again, depending 
on the configuration. AOL instant messenger also utilises both tcp and 
udp protocols on the same port (531).

Wrong again! Check the documentation for the databases I mentioned 
properly and you will see that MySQL could use 3306 utilising both tcp 
and udp protocols, PostgreSQL can also utilise both protocols on its 
common port (5432) and with the case of Oracle - although the commonly 
used Oracle port is 1521 it also utilises ports 2483 (for insecure) and 
2484 (for secure) client connections replacing the 'old' 1521 port for 
insecure client connections.

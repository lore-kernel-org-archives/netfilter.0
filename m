Dear Patrick,

thank you kindly for the "Introduction to C" session. Your pointers
were of most use. However, I must note that failing to know the
purpose of print_string() calls in my code, in both occasions that
they appear in the code I posted, you failed slightly to understand
the severity of the warnings that the compiler "screamed in terror"
about. In both points, they are merely there for logging to the
current tty, as an alternative to printk. As a concequence of that,
they are being commented in and out of the running code, as debugging
requires at that particular moment.

The last point, and of interest to me at that moment, was solved by
Wei and this code seems to work:

my_ipheader =3D (struct iphdr *)((*skb)->nh.iph);

as I was quick to post back in the thread, for the reference of others.

Please feel free to correct my code in the other thread, with subject
"How to change the source address of a tcp packet", with the same
enthusiasm. I would be, again, most thankful.

kind regards,
JC

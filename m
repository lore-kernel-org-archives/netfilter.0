The RFC was not written prior to the implementation but after it has
been around for a while.

The current netlink code implementation defines the standard. It is the
standard because we have not been breaking it and will never do.

Netlink is very open minded, it does not care if individual protocols
define their own semantics. Most will never make use of the above but
it is perfectly legal to do so.

NLM_F_MULTI && NLMSG_DONE is simply a way to have the receiver
continue recieving and parsing. The flag states "Wait, be patient,
my reply consists of multiple messages" and nothing more.

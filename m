Yes. There is no other way to make it.

You are not adding an attribute to the payload of the netlink message
but a new message type...

BTW, don't change the layout of xt_nfacct_match_info, leave it as is.
Only use struct nf_acct  *nfacct __aligned(8); in struct
xt_nfacct_match_info_v1, OK?

OK, makes sense.

This is the most generic thing to make it.

How the user will inspect if quota has been already fulfilled? And how
will the user reset it in case it needs it? Or simply upgrade the
quota without reloading the rule? You have to provide a netlink
interface if you want to implement this in a nice way.  Otherwise, I
bet that someone will come with yet another hackish /proc interface
for this, no please. Or worst, people will code perl scripts to parse
the iptables -L -n output.

Of course, it's more code to nfnetlink_acct, the libraries and the
utility, but this will be pretty generic and we'll provide a nice
interface.

And again, thinking of nftables, if we implement the quota management
code in nfnetlink_acct, adding support for nfacct and quota will just
require very little code since we'll reuse most of the common
infrastructure.

I really think the quota management code belongs nfnetlink_acct, not
xt_nfacct.

Right.

I see!

Would it be possible to have 'something', which disregards the protocol 
on port matching?

By 'something' I mean either omission of the protocol, or 'all' to be 
specified instead of the protocol to mean no matching on protocol would 
be made (in other words the protocol to be disregarded). This will be 
especially useful for sets with quite a few number of members and will 
avoid unnecessary duplication - as things stand I have to add the same 
number of members for both tcp and udp protocols when I don't need any 
protocol matching - just the subnets and port numbers I specified. Is 
this doable?

For me it won't really make a difference as I am always building the 
kernel from source and apply quite a few (I think 11 at the last count) 
patches myself - adding one more won't make any difference. With most 
Fedora distributions the position is exactly the same - they supply one 
or two patches with xtables as well so it won't be something new.

The way I see it, it is best to leave 4.x tree for versions up to 2.6.24 
and leave 5.x for newer versions and then decide whether the netlink 
patch should be applied (my understanding is that if the kernel version 
is >= 2.6.31 the patch definitely needs to be applied - is that right?).

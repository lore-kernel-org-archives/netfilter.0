Tried it, and it works.

It's definitely not user friendly to have to add it, especially since
I expected having a chain with no rules to be a noop.
I don't know how nftables works well enough to comment on one design
choice or another, so I can't comment if this needs to be fixed, but
this definitely feels inconsistent and buggy.

I'm sorry for repeating myself, however I'd like to stress out again,
that while your workaround fixes an inconsistency between iptables and
nftables, the scenario itself is caused by the buggy behaviour of
masquerade with "lo", and that needs to be fixed too. The workaround
above, and any fixes to that issue will only fix the dropping of the
packets, but the wrong rewrite will still be there.

Please let me know if there's anything else you'd like me to test.

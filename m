Was not planned; I hardly see a case where there is a reason to mix
two versions of out-of-tree modules. (There is always a lockstep
update of both kernel and user side when using Xt-a.)

The genl patch was solely made for the users wanting to try ipset5.

I cannot say I am happy about it either, knowing about the nfnetlink
doctrine. You say genl does not buy us anything, but I feel people
have not thought about what nfnl could possibly buy over genl. Right
now, nfnl has two drawbacks: preallocated IDs and extra memory use.

There were no intentions of inclusion of this genl patch, though that
does not mean I prohibit its integration.

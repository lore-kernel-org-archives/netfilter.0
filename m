no, of course not.  You seem to have a basic misunderstanding about
network topology.  A and B are on the same layer 2, they are never sent
through your gateway.  The GW is only involved when the packet needs to
be passed from one layer 2 segment to the other layer 2 segment.

No.  And this is not a limitation of iptables, it's a fundamental
principle of ethernet.

The kernel uses the sets to match the source/destination addresses of IP 
packets. And those are host, that is single IP addresses (not counting 
broadcast, multicast addresses).

The userspace testing is passed to the kernel for execution. There's no
shadow or backup or whatever set in userspace. The sets exist in kernel 
space and therefore all operations happen there.

Why do you need such tests at all?

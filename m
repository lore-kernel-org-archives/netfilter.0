Clone the git tree, then checkout the ipset-5 branch:

% git clone git://git.netfilter.org/ipset.git
% cd ipset
% git checkout ipset-5

I can think only that you still have the unpatched kernel binary running. 
Please note, netlink cannot be compiled as module, it's in the core 
kernel. So it's required to reboot using the patched kernel core.

I see. Sorry, it's not possible to use ipset for this purpose: there are 
no iterators which'd return the members of a set (listing is not similar 
or applicable). To design such an interface is not trivial. Maybe instead 
of iterating, passing your function to ipset is more feasible: ipset would 
call your function for every member of the given set.

(I Cc-ed netfilter-devel, because that's more appropriate list for such a 
discussion.)

Best regards,

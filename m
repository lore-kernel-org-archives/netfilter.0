My NAT box has two interfaces:
  
   eth1 (to my ISP): 64.x.y.z
   eth0 (my private net):(192.168.1.0/24)

   I also have a rule performing MASQUERAD in the
FORWARD chain, 192.168.1.0 -> 64.x.y.z perform SNAT.

   My snmp manager is a linux box from another public
IP address.
   I can use snmpwalk from manager :

    snmpwalk -v2c -c public 64.x.y.z ip
   to get all ip MIBS, however, instead of getting
ipAddrEntry with 64.x.y.x, I am still getting
192.168.1.5. The nat_help() in ip_nat_snmp_basic.c did
not get called from nat core at all. My printk()
messages did not show-up on the log/console.

   I should not have to do anything with snmp trap at
this point yet right?

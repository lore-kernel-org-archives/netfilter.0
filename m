Understood.

I see what you mean, although I personally would use this with an IPSET
target, and I would argue it is the responsibility of the administrator
to ensure it is used correctly.

I didn't know that, but I doubt anyone where I would use it would be
able to do that :-)

The alternative, as I see it, is to adapt hashlimit to have an option to
limit by number of different concurrent streams to different port
numbers (but same source/destination IP address). However, I personally
think it would sit better in connlimit, even if UDP is not a connection
by strict definition.

Is it something you would consider, or shall I look at it myself?

With regards to Patrick's comment, IIRC this was one of the points he
originally raised.

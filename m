Given that ports are only meaningful in the context of a protocol I don't 
think that makes sense. If I want to block traffic to "port 80" in order to 
prevent access to a web server then what I'm rally saying is that I want 
top block traffic to "tcp port 80". There is no point in blocking udp port 
80 too. While there are some servers out there that use connections on the 
same port on both udp and tcp (e.g. DNS) these are the exception and should 
still be handled explicitly by defining rules for both protocols separately.
Why would you want to match a port for all protocols? Do you have a 
specific example for that?

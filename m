I was considering the scenario in which we only remove the pptp
module, so my proposal was to get rid of the gre entry that were
created through the pptp helper as well.  But we don't seem to do that
in any of our helpers and I think that cleanup is not possible in all
cases.

I'll take your patch, thanks.

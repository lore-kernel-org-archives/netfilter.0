Hi!

The netfilter project presents:

  * ulogd 2.0.0beta4

ulogd is a userspace logging daemon for netfilter/iptables related
logging. This includes per-packet logging of security violations,
per-packet logging for accounting purpose as well as per-flow logging.

ulogd comes in two flavours: ulogd-1.x has been around since 2000 and is
the stable series. All production systems should use the stable series
at this time. The 1.x series are frozen, do not expect new features into
this line. ulogd-2.x is currently in beta stage.

This release includes several fixes, improvements and the new XML output
plugin for packet and log-based logging.

You can download them from:

http://www.netfilter.org/projects/ulogd/downloads.html
ftp://ftp.netfilter.org/pub/ulogd/

happy logging,
Pablo (on behalf of the Netfilter project)

Hi, Jordan,

I'll sort out observations from your report and try to explain my idea in
other mail after finishing some tests.

Yes, but from this log, we can say only that source address of TCP packet
was mangled, OR the source address of IP header in ICMP body was mangled.

Inserting LOG rule just before REJECT rule will clarify that.

If TCP packet is valid, yes. If not, no address is mangled.

The current NAT code does that, but I suspect that it is due to bug.

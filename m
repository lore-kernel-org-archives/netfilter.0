Hi!

I've just released the long-awaited new version of the PPTP
conntrack/NAT helper.  It can be found in the current patch-o-matic CVS,
or in the CVS snapshot that is going to be created tonight
(patch-o-matic-20030922).

It has been working in my test network with four PPTP clients, in mixed
DNAT, SNAT and local (i.e. terminated on a PPTPD on the NAT gw itself)
connection setup - both with and without CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_LOCAL.

Please feel free to test this new patch and report any bugs/errors back
to me.

Thanks to everybody who has contibuted to the PPTP helper in the past,
and thanks for your patience in waiting for this release.

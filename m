Multiple table objects are possible in Xtables2, I do not think
it's something exclusive to nft.
It is just that I do not see a usecase and hence a need for multiple
active tables, so the netns only stores one.

So now xt2 gets copied... hmm must be a successful concept :)

There are no traces of pernet operations for nft in 3cb3000158^{tree}.

In all fairness, I have never said anything about dropping nft.
I am focused on xt2, its inclusion and subsequent maintenance, because 
it resolves the ipt shortcomings in a way that I think appeals most to 
the userspace crowd.


>and write something from scratch as flexible as it is

I am avoiding from-scratch where possible. Given that ip_tables.c
exposes its ABI to userspace so much and deferred ruleset operations
to userspace as well, it is nearly impossible to change, and so
inherently, there will be some new code for any future replacement.
But it is my credo to reuse, and I do.

How are users supposed to know how nftables is designed?

Xtables2 has documentation, explains where and why it deviates from 
iptables. If there is only a doubt in your mind, @Dear Users, mail it -
I want the doc to leave no question unanswered.


If the "flexibility" mentioned above is important to you, I encourage
you to checkout xtables2 and give some thought on how your feature
could be integrated into it. Or rather, I'll offer on top: describe
the feature, and I write it.

We used ng_netflow before PF_RING. There was a lot of problems with
ksocket udp packets loss in the BSD kernel.  After that we have
switched to the ntop solution.
Ipt_NETFLOW provides basic v5 support, but as I already said doesn't
have flexible configuration and other features. So I intend to make
universal module and start with v5.

If I am no mistaken, for all packets whose mac doesn't match to the
nic mac pkt_type is set to PACKET_OTHERHOST.
Iptables drop packets with PACKET_OTHERHOST, I don't remember exactly
where, may be in ip_rcv routine.

This is a known limitation of iptables:

/* FIXME: This scheme doesn't allow two of the same
   matches --RR */

It looks like fixing it would break compatibility because currently
arguments to matches can occur at any position:

iptables -A OUTPUT -m addrtype -p tcp --dst-type BROADCAST

I suggest you add the second match to a new chain and jump to it
from the first match.

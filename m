Hi!

The Netfilter project presents another development release of the 
conntrack-tools. This release includes several fixes for the command 
line tool and lots of improvements for the daemon. Specifically I'd like 
to thank Hannes Eder, Vincent Jardin and Samuel Gauthier for their 
suggestions and contributions.

Please, see changelog attached for more details.

I'd also like to thank 6WIND <www.6wind.com> for sponsoring the 
development of two new features that are included in this release: the 
new TCP-based state-synchronization approach and a new feature that 
allows to disable the internal and the external caches. They have also 
helped auditing the code and doing bug hunting.

Q: How stable are the conntrack-tools?
A: The daemon that allows to synchronize states between firewalls has 
been tested in a cluster environment composed of two stateful firewalls 
running Debian 5.0 (Lenny) with a Linux kernel 2.6.32, keepalived 
1.1.15, using conntrackd in FT-FW mode. The test consisted of 
downloading the Linux kernel source code in a tarball file via HTTP and 
randomly (in periods of 10 seconds) unplugging cablelinks to force the 
fail-over between the nodes. The results has shown no hangs/closure in 
any TCP connection.

Q: What are the conntrack-tools?
A: The conntrack-tools are:

- The userspace daemon so-called conntrackd that covers the specific
aspects of stateful Linux firewalls to enable high availability
solutions. It can be used as statistics collector of the firewall use as
well. The daemon is highly configurable and easily extensible.

- The command line interface (CLI) conntrack that provides an interface
to add, delete and update flow entries, list current active flows in
plain text/XML, current IPv4 NAT'ed flows, reset counters, and flush the
complete connection tracking table among many other.

Q: Where can I download it from?
A: http://www.netfilter.org/projects/conntrack-tools/downloads.html

Q: Where can I get more information about them?
A: http://conntrack-tools.netfilter.org

Q: Where can I have a look at the user manual?
A: http://conntrack-tools.netfilter.org/manual.html

On behalf of the Netfilter Core Team,
Pablo.

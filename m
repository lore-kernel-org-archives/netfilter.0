yes, indeed.  There are numerous patches that would not work in the
2.6.x kernels.  They have yet to be identified.  Once they are
identified, we can put a special "requires" tag into the 'info' file of
those patches.

This way the 2.4 only patches would only be offered if you have a 2.4.x
kernel source (and vice-versa).

You could help us in finding out which patches compile and which ones
don't.

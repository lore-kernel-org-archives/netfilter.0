There is a difference between being RFC compliant, and being usable.

Most SIP sotfwares I know will break with such a stupid CISCO behavior.

This seems a hack to me, sorry. How many different vendors will switch
to "Cisco" broken way, and we have to patch over and over ?

I would like to get an exact SIP exchange to make sure their is not
another way to handle this without adding a "Cisco" string somewhere...

Please provide a pcap or tcpdump -A

Thanks

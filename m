The first patch looks fine. As for the second one, I would like
to understand why we're seing these packets. The VLAN driver uses
the original headroom plus the space it needs itself, which suggests
that the underlying driver specifies an incorrect headroom.
The driver doesn't appear to be part of the mainline kernel though.

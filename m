Good news, Everyone! (TM)

The netfilter core team announces a new release of the netfilter
patch-o-matic suite:

	patch-o-matic-20030912

This release contains the most up-to-date bugfixes and new features for=20
the netfilter/iptables subsystem of the 2.4.x Linux kernel.  It supports
kernels >=3D 2.4.18

The patches are devided into several repositories.  Which ones are to be
used, depends on how conservative or adventurous the user is ;)

'submitted':
	Patches which have been submitted for kernel inclusion, most of
	which have already appeared in 2.4.22.  It's really recommended
	to always apply these. =20

'pending':
	Patches currently pending for kernel inclusion.  They will
	almost certainly appear in 2.4.23 or one of the next official
	kernel releases.

'base':
	New features which are self-contained enough so it's sure they
	don't clash with each other.  Those are safe in the way that they
	don't harm already existing functionality.  Playing with them
	might discover one or the other remaining bug... you've been
	warned.

'extra':
	New features which might cause other patches from 'extra' to
	clash with each other.  Most interestingly, you will find here
	conntrack/nat helpers for H.323, PPTP, talk/ntalk, rsh, tftp,
	mms and amanda.

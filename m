Jozsef,
  just my 3c on this discussion to see if its any help.

As you say Mr Dash Four brings up a good point about confusion. It 
certainly seems to confuse him/her, and very likely others with less 
documentation reading experience.

IME the practice when this type of thing happens is good to find some 
alternative clear naming for the parameters and to deprecate the old 
ones. That allows the old names to be dropped from documented use, but 
kept supported for existing config with a warning that admin need to 
check the docs for new usage.

For myself, given the man page snippet it is clear what you intended 
src/dst to be the "local" src/dst. But it is inconsistent with iptables 
usages of src/dst and will trip up anyone not reading that page. Which 
is not a good situation to be in.

Having been in that situation myself I sympathize and had this same 
argument about the same scope concept with other developers several 
times now. We usually end up using some form of "local" terminology for 
the box internal details to differentiate from end-to-end scope 
terminology. In this case --iface-ip / --oface-ip would probably be the 
clearest contenders for your selection. But that is up to you.

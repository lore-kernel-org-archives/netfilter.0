RFC4475 gives no exemple explicitly about missing CSeq-headers, but it=20
has some exemples for bad CSeq-headers in =A73.1.2.4, =A73.1.2.17 and =A7=
3.3.8=20
where it expects 400 Bad request response.

In addition, =A73.3.1 "Missing Required Header Fields" shows that 400 B=
ad=20
Request is also expected in the case of missing Call-ID, From, or To=20
mandatory headers. Taking into account RFC3261 =A78.1.1, CSeq is also a=
=20
mandatory header in the same way as Call-ID, From, or To, so the same=20
answer should be expected.

RFC3261 =A721.4.1 shows that 400 Bad request is to be used for missing=20
headers.

This is _not_ how it works.  Please just DNAT the 1723/tcp connection.
The gre connection is DNAT'ed accordingly (just like with any other nat
helper).  so please skip the second rule

> iptables -A FORWARD -p TCP -d <winip> --dport 1723 -j ACCEPT
> iptables -A FORWARD -p GRE -d <winip> -j ACCEPT

Those are not stateful rules.  You should make sure that you only accept=20
ESTABLISHED and RELATED gre.  Otherwise weird problems might occur.

If it still doesn't work, please check if you have enabled
CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_LOCAL or not.  (try it with and without).

If it still doesn't work, please enable debugging (set the '#if 0' to
'#if 1' in ip_conntrack_pptp.c and ip_nat_pptp.c, ignore the compiler
warnings and send me the syslog excerpt of _one_ failing session.

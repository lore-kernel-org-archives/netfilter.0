Ok, this sounds like a pretty clear case than.  This bug has not been
found because replying with RST afer FIN+ACK seems a quite unusual
pattern.

yes, I totally agree with you.  I'll apply your proposed patch to
patch-o-matic.  If Jozsef disagrees, he can revert that change.

again agreed.  Jozsef, what do you think?

yes, it was more cache line friendly.  But then, wouldn't we get lots of
unaligned accesses?  oh you made a u32 aligned version...

this makes the code really hard to read.  If you can come up with some
easy-to-read macros, I'd be willing to give it a try.

yes, I'm interested - providing the code is not crippled by bit-shifts
and multiplications everywhere.

I have to weight the "great deal of inconsistency and inconvenience" 
caused to you against breaking firewall setups out there. I really 
appreciate your comments, but in this case you should adapt.

Do you think all admins constantly read all changelogs, mailing lists 
about all the software they use to catch backward incompatible changes? 
You are aware of the "inconveniece", and you could adapt yourself to it 
anytime. I'm responsible for every user, for those who never read these 
mailing lists as well.

Feel free to involve anyone. Just to sum up: in the case of the 
net:hash,iface type of ipset, the manpage says

"The second direction parameter of the set match and SET target modules 
corresponds to the incoming/outgoing interface: src to the incoming one 
(similar to the -i flag of iptables), while dst to the outgoing one 
(similar to the -o flag of iptables)."

You argue that the meaning of src/dst for the interface part is 
counter-intuitieve and therefore must be reversed - regardless of the 
backward compatibility issue and the possible breaking of existing setups.

Best regards,
Jozsef

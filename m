I have more information o this problem. I have also cc'd the development
list as I think this could be a bug, but it is probably something I'm
doing wrong :)

With the test machine on another subnet that the REDIRECT linux box,
everything works up until the return packet to the client with the HTTP
body. Running ethereal shows that the test workstation gets a packet,
but the src port is 1 and not 80 as it should be.

Adding some prink's into ipt_REDIRECT shows that when it goes through
that module the port numbers are correct. I turned on debugging in
ipt_nat_core.c and get this output:

It looks like right after 'Trying implicit mapping' the SRC port gets
changed to 1, when it should be 80. I've poked around ip_nat_core.c but
have never looked in there before and can't find the problem. Am I
looking to deep? Is it something more simple that this? I tried this
with 2.6.11.4 and had the same result. Thanks!!

Subject: Transparent Proxy using bridging 2.6.9 and REDIRECT on
differentsubnet

I have the following setup

Test Machine ---> Linux 2.6.9 ---> Internet Router (Doing NAT)
192.168.255.152   192.168.255.165   192.168.255.1/24
				            192.168.12.1/24

I have blacked out all my iptables and ebtables all default ACCEPT
policy.

The Linux 2.6.9 is bridging. I use the following rule to redirect port
80 traffic to Squid on the Linux 2.6.9 box:

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i br0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT
--to-port 3128

This works just like it should. No problem. The problems comes in this
setup:

Test Machine ---> Linux 2.6.9 ---> Internet Router (Doing NAT)
192.168.255.152   192.168.12.165    192.168.255.1
				            192.168.12.1

When the Linux box is on a different subnet that the test machine the
request will get to Squid, the rules get a packet count I see squid get
the request. Then squid try to send the request back to the client and
it hangs up. The browser just spins. The test machine and the Linux
2.6.9 can both ping each other so I know connectivity is ok.

Now if I bring up an alias br0:0 192.168.255.165 in the above setup,
then everything works again. So does the br0 have to have an ip on the
same subnet for REDIRECT to work? I have also tried adding ebtables
rules like:

ebtables -t broute -A BROUTING -p IPv4 --ip-protocol 6 \
        --ip-destination-port 80 -j redirect --redirect-target ACCEPT

Makes no difference. I have also tried some more complex variations
like:

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -m physdev --physdev-in eth1
--dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 3128
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i br0 --dport -j DNAT --to
i92.168.12.165:3128

All see to work the same. Broken :) I have messed around with settings
on /proc/sys/net to no avail.

I'm using iptables v1.2.9 and Linux 2.6.9. Debian Woody. Thanks!!

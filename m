Thinking further on this...

Unless I'm missing something the above only specifies when to log
quota transgression, hence introducing the need to write yet another
rule do explicitly deal with the packet.  My previous solution logged
quota excess _and_ dealt with the packet.

Using ' nfulnl_log_packet()' (if even possible) would seem hackish to me.

Can you suggest anything that would unite our two vision?

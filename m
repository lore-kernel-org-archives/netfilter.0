The code says.

static int owner_check(const struct xt_mtchk_param *par)
{
	struct xt_owner_match_info *info = par->matchinfo;

	/* For now only allow adding matches from the initial user namespace */
	if ((info->match & (XT_OWNER_UID|XT_OWNER_GID)) &&
	    (current_user_ns() != &init_user_ns))
		return -EINVAL;
	return 0;
}

So it is not expected to work in user namespaces by design.

As I recall this code largely matches directly on the values passed in
from userspace.  Which in this case is a problem because I would like to
store kuids and kgids in the data structures and compare those.

I believe it would take some careful refactoring to allow massaging the
data from the form the user supplied to something more appropriate
before we perform the match.

That is making this work is tricky so I punted and did not support it
from inside a user namespace.

Each process opens 200 sockets, then closes them. And repeats ad infinitum. But I might have to be clever since I can't run 500 000 processes; but I could run 20 VMs; that would get it down to about 12 000 processes per VM. And I might have to figure out how to allow allow processes on the destination system to open hundreds or thousands of sockets.

Should I resend the patch with a Tested-by: tag?

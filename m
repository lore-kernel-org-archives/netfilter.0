I see.  I have no nice solution for this problem.  What could be done
is adding a --check-only option to nfacct to only query but not
increment the quota counter, then you could use the 'two-rules' approach
you described earlier.  (one rule to increment quotas per-packet but only match
exactly once when the current packet brings us over the quota, another
rule to 'passively' check against the limit).

Another option would be to using connmarks or connlabels to flag when
a connection is overlimit or has already been logged.  I understand
that this would be cumbersome though (also adds the conntrack dependency).

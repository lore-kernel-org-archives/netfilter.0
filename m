i run into one problem with PPTP conntrack:

run it with debug on: works
run it w/out debug on: does not.

i also turned on the patch below and configure the CONFIG_NETFILTER_DEBUG=
:
compile ip_conntrack_pptp with debug on: all ok
compile ip_conntrack_pptp w/out debug: does not even print the ASSERT rea=
dlock=20
statements from CONFIG_NETFILTER_DEBUG, PPTP connection is not establishe=
d.

this debug issue was tracked down to a single printk statement in=20
ip_conntrack_pptp.c: line 244,245:

DEBUGP("%s, CID=3D%X, PCID=3D%X\n", strMName[msg]                 =20
                     ntohs(*cid), ntohs(*pcid));

i run this on a 2.4.17 mips little endian, single proc, latest pptp ALG f=
iles=20
from netfilter, newnat13.

how this can be ?=20

thanks for any input,
marian

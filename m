Ah.  This is a point where my assumptions has failed. :)

So, when I can't use DROP in iptables, can I do it with ebtables 
instead?  That is, is it possible to mark packets with iptables and 
drop them with ebtables?  Something like this:

iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -m conntrack --ctorigdst <int> -j 
ACCEPT
iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -j MARK --set-mark 1

ebtables -t nat -A POSTROUTING --mark 1 -j DROP

I know that this exact example does not work, but not why it fails.

I'm starting to believe that what I want to achieve here is impossible 
with iptables/ebtables, and any ideas on what I should try/explore 
would me most welcome.

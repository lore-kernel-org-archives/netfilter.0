Thank you very much but could you please explain this a bit more.  Oskar
Andreasson's tutorial explicitly mentions doing this, i.e., incrementing
TTL and we thought it was a good idea.  We certainly want to change our
ways if this is dangerous.  Here is the excerpt from the tutorial:

The --ttl-inc option tells the TTL target to increment the Time To Live
value with the value specified to the --ttl-inc option. This means that
we should raise the TTL value with the value specified in the --ttl-inc
option, and if we specified --ttl-inc 4, a packet entering with a TTL of
53 would leave the host with TTL 56. Note that the same thing goes here,
as for the previous example of the --ttl-dec option, where the network
code will automatically decrement the TTL value by 1, which it always
does. This may be used to make our firewall a bit more stealthy to
trace-routes among other things. By setting the TTL one value higher for
all incoming packets, we effectively make the firewall hidden from
trace-routes.

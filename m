I dare to say it's easy. The real problem is rather, that UDP is
connectionless, so for one, connlimit can, by definition of the word
'connectionless', not apply to UDP, though it is technically
possible. Second, because UDP "connections" "fly" (timeout after 30
seconds), just spewing one UDP packet out may kill another connection
(e.g. if you use connlimit in conjunction with DROP or REJECT).
What's more, UDP packets can be easily forged, much more than TCP, so
anyone on the same subtree (not subnet, because that's something
different) can send a bogus UDP packet and stop your connections from
working.
Let's see how to implement UDP counting...

My lone self presents:

	nftables-plus 0.099


Overview
========

A package that is based upon nftables and adds usability patches.


Status
======

In this first addon release, the build system was converted to automake 
to give distributions a better build experience.


Naming
======

	What's in a name?


Resources
=========

nftables-plus is obtainable from

http://xtables.de/
git://git.xtables.de/nftables-plus

The same build requirements as plain nftables apply. Apparently 
minus lex and bison, which have become optional.

The code appears now.

The reason why I said that b-trees are not used in hipac was that the b-tre=
es=20
are not the main data structure and are not the main solution of the proble=
m.

The problem is solved by a graph that consists of a lot of nodes.

During a lookup this graph is traversed and each node that is visited=20
internally uses again a certain data structure. In 2003 btrees were used=20
internally at each node of the graph. In the current implementation simple=
=20
static binary search is used instead.

So basically you can forget about the btrees. They are not important for th=
e=20
solution of the problem. Have a closer look at the slides of the more recen=
t=20
presentations.

Best regards

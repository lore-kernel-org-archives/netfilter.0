Hi Henrik,

In case of partail request, too I found the packets where not dropping. 
I had checked it by using nf-drill.pl, given in the FTP advisory. Modify 
the script to give a partial PORT command. The packet goes across the 
firewall and reaches the FTP server. I have connected my FTP server to 
DMZ and running the script from the LAN side.
Setting connection mark does work, but for the next packet and not the 
current one.

Thanks and Regards,
Vinod C

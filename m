That's just not true; I did post before on the xt2 matter as well,
in its various stages.

There is even older experimenting stuff in my git repo, which you
can look at. (The dates are not forged - you will have to trust me
on that.)



Each of us are (understandably) biased, as each has contributed
to "their" implementation. But, you also have the decisive power
as the Linux kernel Netfilter subsystem maintainer, and I fear
that you might use this to reject xt2 to force nft.
That thought _terrifies_ me, and were it so, it would not be an
environment I want to work in.

Just say so if I am to GTFO.

This is so wrong. Any connection that *Netfilter* (not specifically
the networking stack) does not yet know about is NEW. That might
even be in the middle of a TCP stream -- you can do it: conntrack -F
will clear all connections and thus they will begin with NEW. Not
that this is something you randomly do on a router which only allows
ESTABLISHED or NEW-combined-with-SYN -matched packets.

Well they don't go through, hence this is moot. The TCP stack of
the final destination will also be confused. Different port --
different connection. Basic rules of networking.

Same here. A (src, sourceport, dst, dstport) tuple uniquely identifies a
connection. If you change something in this tuple, it is, by definition,
a new one.

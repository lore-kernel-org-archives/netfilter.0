Most likely you're changing the source to a non-local address in
LOCAL_OUT, causing rerouting of the packet and resulting in an
input route instead of an output one. When dst_output is called
you hit ip_rt_bug, dropping the packet. When this is the first
packet of a connection, the connection tracking entry and
NAT mappings are destroyed. Not sure whats causing the RSTs
then, but its probably related to that.

Does changing:

         return ip_route_me_harder(skb, RTN_UNSPEC);

to

         return ip_route_me_harder(skb, RTN_LOCAL);

in net/ipv4/netfilter.c:nf_ip_reroute have any effect?

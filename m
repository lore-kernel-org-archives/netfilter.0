yes, that's true.  I think we cannot state often enogh: DO NOT load
iptable_nat if you don't need nat. =20

NAT is inherently complex.  and in order to support any kind of nat,
every connection (even the non-nat'ed ones) need to be placed in two
additional hash tables. =20

If you just use conntrack, a single hash table is sufficient..=20

There is no way to 'address' this issue other than not using NAT.

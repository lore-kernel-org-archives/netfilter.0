Sounds like genl could benefit from a pinning mechanism; rather than
just using CTRL_CMD_GETFAMILY, a CTRL_CMD_GETIT would use
module_get(genl_ops->owner) to grab the module, with the reverse
being a CTRL_CMD_PUTBACK, which is then also implicit on closing the
nl socket.

Some distributors also package kernels patched with random things.

=46alls under the well-known answer field of "those who have no clue
should not touch it".

Not providing a tarball, not providing a diff, stowing away the code
in git, and stowing it away in a non-default branch as is done with
ipset-genl keeps out the worst offenders.

Getting involved in NF packages in major distros works proactively
against incompatible or rotten package submissions.

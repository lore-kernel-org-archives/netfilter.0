You've failed to read the docs :)

you didn't run ./runme --batch pending
after that CONNMARK works fine.

(two patches in pending won't apply correctly, they need to be applied
after the newnat patch and not before (just run the same command one
more time and they should apply), I've just fixed it in cvs)

Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level, then beat

Well, I certainly have done that already ;-) But I have checked kfree()
and vfree() and they have a sanity check for NULL before processing, as
well as those are also the well-known semantics for the userspace free()
call. It seems to me (and I recognize that my understanding is limited)
that it could do no harm and may even help in certain cases. Am I
missing something in why it would be preferable _not_ to check for NULL
in kfree_skb()? Is it a performance issue associated with the extra
overhead of having to check for NULL on every kfree_skb[_fast]() call?
And, if so, could we possibly document in the source code and/or kernel
documentation in order to let less experienced programmers know that
they should under no circumstances pass NULL into these functions? I
certainly didn't know that, since I was working off of the semantics of
the other kernel *free() functions. Help me understand my error in
judgement. Thanks :)

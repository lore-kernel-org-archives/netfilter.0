The situation is deliberate, yes. IPsec is done in what you could
call the xfrm subsystem, not netfilter. To that end, the only
suggestion I could give is that you create a new xfrm policy/state
from esp where esp is split into your encryption and signing
"targets".

It kinda brings me the question why the ipsec transformation is
not done with an xtables target instead; that would also give
handy access to connection tracking if needed.

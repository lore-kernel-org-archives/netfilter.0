that one should be just fine.

you cannot just compare TCP socket states with connection tracking
states.   connection tracking tracks all connections (local and
forwarded ones), and if a connection isn't correctly closed by the
application (FIN handshake), it will assume that the connection still
exists - just one example of why this cannot be compared.

And why do you think there is a  'SNAT' socket state?

can you capture the packets with tcpdump and actually show me that the
machine doesn't in fact have=20

What do you mean 'without state'? There are no connections without
state.  Why can't you show me the respective lines from
/proc/net/ip_conntrack.

And why are you under the impression that /proc/net/ip_conntrack shows
only nat'ed connections?  The name of the file indicates 'conntrack', so
it shows you all tracked connections - not all NAT'ed.

As of now, it seems to me that there are some significant
misunderstandings about the principles of netfilter/iptables. Please
discuss this at the mailinglist and get back to me if you are really
sure this is a bug.

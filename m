Hi,

I'm happy to announce ipset 6.15, which brings a few bugfixes and 
corrections. The most important is that there was a range input bug in 
hash:ip,port,net type: if a single element was to be added/deleted, due to 
a missing initialization, a range of elements were added/deleted.

From now on the "ipset" tool uses gethostbyname2 instead of getaddrinfo: 
in newer glibc, getaddrinfo issues an extra system call to kernel, which 
slows down ipset.

Userspace changes:
 - Fix interactive mode (Fredrik Eriksson)
 - Use gethostbyname2 instead of getaddrinfo
 - Make tests/check_cidrs.sh script executable
 - Add tests to check completely ranges with hash types
 - Make easier to apply the netlink.patch
 - Support protocol numbers as well, not only protocol names
 - Add (back) the debug flag to configure
 - Add simple test to check cidr book-keeping

Kernel part changes:
 - Increase the number of maximal sets automatically as needed
 - Restore the support of kernel versions between 2.6.32 and 2.6.35
 - Fix range bug in hash:ip,port,net
 - Revert, then reapply cidr book keeping patch to handle /0

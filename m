Let's analyze in 3-step manner:

Claim: writes always happen to e->stamps[0]
Prereqs: ip_pkt_list_tot==1
Proof:
 Start with assumption that e->index's possible values at the
 start of the function are {0}.
 The timestamp is thus always stored in e->stamps[0].
 e->index is bumped from 0 to 1.
 The %= op clamps it back to 0.
 The possible values at the end of the function are thus {0}.
 Assumption holds and matches the result set exactly.
 Outside of the function you will thus never see e->index != 0.

This does not seem much different from your proposed patch,
which reads like:

Claim: same
Prereq: same
Proof:
 e->index's possible start values are {0,1}.
 The %= op clamps this to {0}.
 The timestamp is always stored in e->stamps[0].
 e->index is increased by one.
 The possible values at the end of the function are {1}.
 Assumption holds, but is a superset of the result set.
 Outside of the function, you may see e->index != 0.


So both variations of the code do the same, except yours seems to
have the additional potential pitfall that e->index is not within the
ring of modulus after the function has been executed.


Where would the thinko be?

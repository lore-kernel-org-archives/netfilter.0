Hi!

The netfilter project presents another development release of the
conntrack-tools. As usual, this release includes important fixes,
improvements and new features, mainly:

= command line interface: conntrack =

*  New option `-C': you can use it to display the number of entries in
the conntrack and expectation tables.

= userspace daemon: conntrackd =

* Internal performance improvements: important rework of the
hashtable/caching/queueing infrastructure; single output path for state
transmissions; improved event-driven architecture. See ChangeLog
attached for more details.

* Support for multi-dedicated links: you can define a pool of dedicated
links, ie. if the current dedicated link fails, another available in the
pool is selected to propagate state-changes. See the example files under
doc/ for more information.

* Extended statistics information: you can display networking, caching,
runtime and queueing statistics with `conntrackd -s [type]'. See the
manpage for more information on the statistics types.

* Polling (or batch-based) synchronization: you can configure the daemon
to send batches periodically instead of the soft real-time state
synchronization. This allows you to set up a relaxed replication while
consuming less computational resources. See `PollSecs' clause.

Q: How stable are the conntrack-tools?
A: This software is under development. Nevertheless, it has been tested
in a cluster environment composed of two stateful firewalls running
Debian 4.0 (Etch) with a Linux kernel 2.6.28, keepalived 1.1.15, using
conntrackd in FT-FW mode, randomly (in periods of 10 seconds) setting
links down to force the fail-over between the nodes. The results has
shown no hangs/closure in any TCP connection.

Q: What are the conntrack-tools?
A: The conntrack-tools are:

- The userspace daemon so-called conntrackd that covers the specific
aspects of stateful Linux firewalls to enable high availability
solutions. It can be used as statistics collector of the firewall use as
well. The daemon is highly configurable and easily extensible.

- The command line interface (CLI) conntrack that provides an interface
to add, delete and update flow entries, list current active flows in
plain text/XML, current IPv4 NAT'ed flows, reset counters, and flush the
complete connection tracking table among many other.

Q: Where can I download it from?
A: http://www.netfilter.org/projects/conntrack-tools/downloads.html

Q: Where can I get more information about them?
A: http://conntrack-tools.netfilter.org

Q: Where can I have a look at the user manual?
A: http://conntrack-tools.netfilter.org/manual.html

On behalf of the Netfilter Project,
Pablo.

The netfilter coreteam proudly presents:

	iptables version 1.4.1-rc1

This release candidate contains a larger number of changes than
usual:

- fixes for some minor issues (mostly compilation problems with
   old kernel headers) in the 1.4.0 release

- big scalability improvements from Jesper Brouer

- A new build system from Jan Engelhardt using autotools

- Support for multiple new matches, targets and revisions

- Continued merging of iptables and ip6tables code, bringing
   new features to ip6tables

- Manpage cleanups and additions

- iptables *should* now build without kernel headers or sources

Additionally work has begun to merge ebtables and arptables
functionality in iptables, this will hopefully continue after
1.4.1 has been released.

Starting with this release candidate, some changes are happening:

- The iptables repository has been moved from SVN to git. The
   Changelog is already in a format that vaguely resembles
   git-shortlog output, but is written manually because SVN
   doesn't track author information (and most likely contains
   a few incorrect attributions). To make this simpler in the
   future, all patch submitters are asked to sign off on their
   patches from now on, similar as for kernel patches. The
   "Developer's Certificate of Origin" from the kernel source
   will be added to iptables.

- The release frequency will be increased, the plan is to
   have one iptables release per kernel release in order to
   get support for new features to users as quickly as
   possible.

I think thats it, so back to this release:

Version 1.4.1-rc1 can be obtained from (please note that the
webpage hasn't been rebuilt yet, but will be shortly):

http://www.netfilter.org/projects/iptables/downloads.html
ftp://ftp.netfilter.org/pub/iptables/
git://git.netfilter.org/iptables.git

Please test and report any problems you might notice. If things
go well, I hope to release 1.4.1 in about two weeks.

On behalf of the Netfilter Core Team.
Happy testing!

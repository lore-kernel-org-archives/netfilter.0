It is older than xtables and has always worked that way. It doesn't
make sense to have the contents dependant on implementation details.
I also know that some UIs rely on having available modules shown,
IIRC one of them was shorewall. This needs to be fixed.

That seems a bit overkill. Text-based representation also doesn't seem
ideal, iptables already has this information and a cmdline user will
simply use "iptables ... -h" to get the supported option. For other
programs a binary representation would probably be easier to handle.

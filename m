I got round this by editing connmark and adding 2 more marks, one for
each direction. When connmark is set, in the conntrack it sets that mark
in the usual place and also in the slot for the current direction.

When the conntrack is used to populate the skb mark, I take the current
direction.

So I get the best of both worlds.

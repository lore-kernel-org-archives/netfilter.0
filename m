Hi all, I'm having this problem with this system configuration:
   1) iptables 1.3.7
   2) kernel 2.6.19.1
   3) SMP computer
   4) 2 external links + 2 internal (bridged).

Some hours after the system is working without any troubles, all network
devices stop respond.

Anyone could help me to fix this problem?

Googling some ours I detect that this was a problem with old kernels and
were solved with 2.6.11 kernel version.

Any help will be appretiated.

Regards.

P.D.: With MASQUERADE the problem begans more quickly than with SNAT target.

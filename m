In net/core/dev.c, the packet is passed to all "taps". Taps include 
raw sockets (think tcpdump), but also bridge and the IPvX layers 
themselves. Each of them basically gets a copy, thus it is important to 
not have an address on the ethernet interface (so that the IPvX tap 
ignores it). Only the bridge interface should have an address, because 
the bridge code will pass it to IPvX on its own.

(You probably knew this, but this is a nice question plus answer for our 
planned book(s).)

So considering only bridge.c, the brouting chain can then be used to 
either move the packet along the blue L2 path or the green L3 path.

If a packet remains travelling in the blue domain (i.e. it is bridged), 
the packet _must_ have the bridge's own dst mac address to go "upwards" 
at the "bridging decision" (sort of Ethernet routing, if you want to 
call it so) circle to reach IPvX routing.

To be eligible for green traversal as a result of (bridge check), the 
packet of course needs to be one of the supported protocols.
Sending STP into the green domain has no bearing. IPX packets will be 
conntracked, but of course you won't see them in iptables or ip6tables 
(since they are not IPv4/IPv6, naturally).

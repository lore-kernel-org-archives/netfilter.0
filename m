Hi,

I've cc'ed this email to netfilter users mailling list since I think 
that this question is not so related with the development.

You can change them via:
- /proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter/ip_conntrack_[tcp|udp]_*
- conntrack tool/libnetfilter_conntrack library

What do you mean with border effects? Of course the behaviour will 
change, think about halted TCP connections for whatever reason, if the 
timeout is higher then they will get stuck longer in the conntrack table.

Which timers are you referring to?

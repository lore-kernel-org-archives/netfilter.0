After looking at the HTB kernel code I believe that the ADSL Optimizer 
project is NOT wrong.  You should/must set the linklayer option on both 
the root class and leaf (else you would be charging the root/parent node 
too little).

It is the expected behavior that small packets cause a significant
reduction in the available bandwidth on the ATM link.  Small packets will 
(almost) always cause 2 ATM packets (being send) using 106 bytes, thus
eg. sending a 40 bytes TCP ACK packet result in approx 62% overhead.

I have fixed it in the git tree, thanks!

I assume you tried to compile the source in the kernel/ directory itself. 
You should have used the toplevel Makefile, as it's stated in the README file.

It's set in the toplevel Makefile and propagated into the EXTRA_CFLAGS of 
kernel/Kbuild.

It's all right, the kernel was not patched.

Again, it's set in the toplevel directory.

After checking out the git tree and working in the toplevel directory, you 
should be able to compile the code without any error.

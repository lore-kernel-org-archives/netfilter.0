Seems like a different issue.

Yes, this is what Alexey was pointing out in the previous email and
why he suggested to move it to nfnetlink_has_listeners (to cover the
expectation case).

But you're right, we cannot move it to nfnetlink_has_listeners because
of the item->report case. Please, include the expectation part and
resend the patch.

Whatever the appropriate place holder is - 'all', '*', '@', '$$$$$$' 
etc. etc - as long as it does the job at the end it won't matter.

I wasn't aware that there are more than 2 (tcp and udp) protocols on 
which I could define/use ports!

What are your plans?

So, in other words 'internally' you store something like (using your 
example above) 192.168.0.0 (the IP part), 30 (the prefix), tcp, 80 in 
the structure, is that right?
Do you then use the mask of each member of that set (30 and 24 in your 
example above) until you get a match? In other words, you 'walk through' 
every internally stored element and try their mask and then lookup for a 
match, is that how you do it?

Thought so!

Could you expand on that bit please? What do you mean?

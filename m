Hi Anthony & all,
Yes,  iam seeing a lot of "ip_conntrack: table full, dropping packet."
messages in dmesg. 
ip_conntrack_max is 131072 not 13072, my mistake, '1' might have got deleted
in my email.

Yes, but I'm asking what evidence you have that the box is *refusing new 
connections*, and that it is doing so *because the maximum number of 
conntracks has been reached*?

Are you getting any messages "ip_conntrack : table full, dropping packet"
in your syslog or kernel log output?

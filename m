Correct, doesn't change anything.

Haven't tried it. Why would it change things? Have you tried it?

The problem is that the IP incorrectly changes to the wrong one.

I think that all throughout this thread we've been analysing the
behaviour in the broken scenario
instead of just fixing it (which I see your latest patch may actually
do, and that's good).
It doesn't matter where the packet goes through after it's been
wrongly rewritten, the
problem is that it has.

It's off.

Interesting. Maybe that's why it continued to work after iptables has
already been loaded on the box.
As said above though, I believe the problem is the masquerade setting
the wrong ip, and not (only?)
the fact that my setup happens to work with iptables but doesn't with nftables.

Don't you agree?

Thanks,
Tom.

If you assume it's the second then it's a good approximation, and 
sufficient to push the TCP on the receiving host into a state from which 
there is a guaranteed timeout as it's then only waiting on itself to 
finish what it is doing.

If the FIN is dropped then communication may stall indefinitely unless the 
protocol is using an application level timeout or TCP keepalive.

It should be the same as a RST in an existing connection, no more, not 
much less. It has some value to the receiving host telling it to shut down 
a matching TCP. But this is considerably less important than the FIN as 
the RST is very unreliable anyway and protocols using initiated RST (not 
in direct response to a received packet) ashould have appropriate 
application level timeouts on their connections.

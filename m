It seems that you are producing interesting stuff for sysadmins.

So, I assume that you are dumping the conntrack every N seconds, I'd 
like to know what is the impact of this in terms of performance on a 
busy firewall (lots of conntrack entries).

I don't know if you had the chance to have a look at conntrackd, its 
statistics mode is still poor but can be improved quite easily. I want 
to implement conntrack dumping in XML format via conntrackd, this can be 
interesting for 3rd party apps. My impression is that this daemon would 
look very similar to mine, so would you consider integrating this with 
conntrackd?

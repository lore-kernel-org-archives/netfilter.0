Hi!

As many of you will have noticed already, I took the liberty to reorganize
the CVS tree structure.  This was needed to get a better seperation
between independent parts of the project. =20

pserver.netfilter.org:/cvspublic now has the following modules:

iptables
	this is what netfilter/userspace used to be

pkttables
	this is what netfilter/iptables2 used to be.

patch-o-matic-ng
	this is the new patch-o-matic, used to live below=20
	/netfilter, too.

documentation
	this is the FAQ's and HOWTO's, used to be
	/netfilter/documentation

homepage
	this is the new docbook-website homepage, used to be
	/netfilter/homepage-xml

security-advisories
	a seperate, new module containing text files of the security
	advisories.  http://www.netfilter.org/security/* is built=20
	from those text files.

We should consider moving away from using the kernel headers directly.
Breaking compilation of old iptables versions is not too bad IMO,
old binaries will still work and someone compiling old iptables with
a new kernel can just as well just compile a new version.

Unfortunately 1.3.6 won't compile with 2.6.19, so we might have to put
out a new version soon.

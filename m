2.6.14 has pptp conntrack/nat in mainline, so I recommend either using
2.6.14-rc3, or wait until 2.6.14 final is reelased.

I didn't do any intermediate ports for 2.6.11. 2.6.12 and 2.6.13.

Though it shouldn't be all that difficult to backport the (new,
pptp-conntrack-3.0) code from 2.6.14-rc3, at least to 2.6.13.  Please
don't forward-port the old code, since there were a number of issues
fixed by the new code.

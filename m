Indeed, I'd prefer adding an extra netlink header with a new type like
NLM_ERROR2 followed by attributes like the string (or an int) that
contain the error.

This also can be added with breaking existing apps and libraries IIRC.

At least, we require the netlink header of the request message in error
messages. This is useful for message batches that are sent to
kernel-space, to know which one triggered the error.

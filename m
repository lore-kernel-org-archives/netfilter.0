Strangely enough, the original motivation for rcu_read_lock_bh() does not
apply to -rt kernels.  The problem was that denial-of-service workloads
could apply such a heavy interrupt load to a given CPU that it never
got back to process-level execution, thus never passing through any
quiescent states.

So rcu-bh has softirq-level quiescent states, solving that problem,
but by disabling softirq (and thus preemption) across the read-side
critical sections.

But -rt has every point in the code not covered by rcu_read_lock()
as a quiescent state, so should not be vulnerable to that particular
denial-of-service attack.  But rcu-bh has the additional semantic of
excluding BH execution while under rcu_read_lock_bh(), which appears
to be used in this case, and probably others as well.

Interesting corner we have painted ourselves into here...

							Thanx, Paul

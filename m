These statements seem to contradict themselves.


Here's a patch so far.

 predefined ports.  If a service does not run on standard port, it is
 necessary to declare it. Before 2.6.34, the only method to do so was
 to use a module option. This was resulting in having a systematic
 parsing of the added port by the choosen helper. This was clearly
 suboptimal and the CT target has been introduced in 2.6.34. It allows
 to specify what helper to use for a specific flow.  For exemple, let's

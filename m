But that relies on the assumption that the receiver side wants to close
the session as well. If it enters the CLOSE_WAIT state instead, the
connection will hang anyway in spite of letting through the FIN and
assuming the LAST_ACK state.

However how would conntrack loose an (established) connection? Or are we
speaking of loading in conntrack "on the fly" when there are already
established connections flowing through the firewall? That's doable
but hairy and unreliable anyway due to the lost window scaling parameters.

Somehow I have got bad feelings on passing random RST segments.

It is assumed (I think) that the hung connection is in the established
state. That does not hurt the host, does not pose as a possible DoS
situation or bottleneck. It also does not prevent establishing a new
connection over the hung one, we make special efforts for enabling that.

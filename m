There is a --path= option which can specify the path to both iptables and 
the kernl.

Please try with the large patch of .ladd files I posted on netfilter-devel 
yesterday.

Yes.

Not unlikely.

Applying "extra" blindly is not recommended. There is reasons to why a 
patch is in "extra", and many of these extensions conflict with each 
other.

If you want patches from extra you better name the patches you want 
explicily, after applying the base set.

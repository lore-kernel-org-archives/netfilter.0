Each process opens 200 sockets, then closes them. And repeats ad infinitum. But I might have to be clever since I can't run 500 000 processes; but I could run 20 VMs; that would get it down to about 12 000 processes per VM. And I might have to figure out how to allow allow processes on the destination system to open hundreds or thousands of sockets.

I applied the 'hammer' through a firewall with the patch. I used TCP,
UDP and ICMP.

I don't know if the patch fixes the problem. But I'm reasonably sure
that it did not break normal operations.

To test a different problem I fixed (a memory leak in my 64-bit
counter patch for xt_ACCOUNT), I tested 60,000 addresses (most of a
/16) through the firewall. Again, no troubles.

I only observed two odd things which are likely completely unrelated
to your patch. When I started the TCP test, then added the UDP test,
only TCP would come through. If I stopped and restarted the TCP test,
only UDP would come through. I suspect this is due to buffering. It's
just a behaviour I haven't encountered since I started using Linux
many years ago (around '98). The second, when I started the test, the
firewall would lose contact with the upstream F/W's apcupsd daemon;
again, this is likely due to the nature of the test: it likely floods
input and output queues.


I'd say you can probably resend with Tested-by.

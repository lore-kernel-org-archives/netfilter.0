TCP is a connection-oriented procol while ICMP isn't. There is no point
in creating a connection entry from a bogus-looking ICMP reply packet.

The packets you generated neither belong nor related to an existing 
connection, thus are marked as INVALID. INVALID packets are not NAT-ed and 
if not dropped explicitely, will be sent out without natted.
